The provided discussions focus on terminal emulator documentation and configuration issues, but do not contain any content related to networking (network protocols, HTTP requests, TCP/IP, DNS, websockets, data transfer, network security, or connection management). 

The discussions cover platform-specific API behavior documentation, cross-platform command line handling, and documentation formatting - none of which relate to networking concepts. Therefore, no meaningful networking-related coding standard can be derived from these discussions.

The discussions would be more appropriate for categories like "Documentation Standards," "Cross-Platform Compatibility," or "Configuration Management" rather than "Networking."
