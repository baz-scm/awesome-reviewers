It's not necessary to mention potential issues at all, if people are running into problems we just need to point them at things they can try. We also don't need to document in Alacritty how other terminal emulators behave.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to how to get this to work, we don't need to really mention anything in the FAQ at all. I'd just add a section to the install.md.",
