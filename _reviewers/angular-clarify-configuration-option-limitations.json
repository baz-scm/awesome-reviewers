        "comment_body": "> you need to provide a configuration object that defines the scope for the service through the `providedIn` key\r\n\r\n`providedIn` isn't actually required; if it's omitted, the service isn't _automatically_ provided, and instead needs to go into the `providers` array of `bootstrapApplication` or a component/directive. The framing here is probably \"automatic provider\" vs. \"manual provider\" \r\n\r\nThis also affects the \"Providing a service\" section below- the `providers` array is _only_ necessary if either:\r\n* You are injecting something that's not `providedIn` root/platform, or\r\n* You explicitly want to provide a new _instance_ of that injectable at that component/directive ",
