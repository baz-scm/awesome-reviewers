Ensure test suites provide comprehensive coverage by including edge cases, different input scenarios, and all code paths. Tests should cover not just the happy path, but also boundary conditions, error cases, and various input combinations.

When writing tests, consider these coverage areas:
- **Edge cases**: Empty inputs, null/undefined values, boundary conditions
- **Input variations**: Different data types, formats, and combinations that the code might encounter
- **Integration scenarios**: How the code behaves with different dependencies or configurations
- **Error conditions**: Invalid inputs, network failures, or other error states
- **State changes**: All possible state transitions and their effects

For example, when testing ARIA property binding:
```typescript
// Don't just test basic functionality
it('should bind ARIA properties', () => {
  // Basic test...
});

// Also test edge cases and variations
it('should bind interpolated ARIA attributes', () => {
  // Test interpolation: aria-label="{{label}} menu"
});

it('should bind ARIA attribute names with hyphens', () => {
  // Test: aria-errormessage, aria-haspopup
});

it('should handle component inputs vs attributes', () => {
  // Test component with ariaLabel input vs aria-label attribute
});
```

Missing test coverage often indicates incomplete understanding of the feature's behavior and can lead to regressions. Comprehensive testing builds confidence in code changes and helps catch issues before they reach production.
