Use a single language (preferably English) consistently throughout your codebase for all identifiers including interface names, classes, variables, and properties. Avoid mixing languages as this reduces code readability and creates inconsistent naming patterns.

**Before:**
```typescript
export interface ModeloBaseDeDatos {
    $id: string;
    name: string;
    permissions: string[];
    // Otros campos: createdAt, updatedAt, etc.
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export interface DatabaseModel {
    $id: string;
    name: string;
    permissions: string[];
    createdAt: string;
    updatedAt: string;
    enabled?: boolean;
}
```

This standard improves code maintainability and helps prevent confusion, especially in projects with international contributors. When choosing names, prefer English for broader accessibility and alignment with most programming languages and frameworks.
