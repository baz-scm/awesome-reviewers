If you specify it on its own without arguments, then it's an error in the command: \r\n\r\n`Error: flag needs an argument: --filter-fields`\r\n\r\nSo, it's just the wording.   Essentially, _without_ the filter-fields option (not providing it on the command line), then the entire manifest is displayed.",
