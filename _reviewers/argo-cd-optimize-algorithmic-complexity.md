Always consider computational complexity and performance when implementing algorithms. Look for opportunities to optimize through early exits, efficient comparison strategies, and avoiding nested loops that create O(N*M) complexity.

Key optimization techniques:
- **Early loop exits**: Break out of loops as soon as the desired condition is met rather than continuing unnecessary iterations
- **Efficient comparisons**: Instead of concatenating strings for comparison, compare fields individually in priority order, returning early when differences are found
- **Avoid nested complexity**: Be mindful of nested loops that can create quadratic or higher time complexity, especially when processing large datasets

Example of optimized comparison:
```go
// Instead of string concatenation comparison:
return fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s/%s", left.Type, left.Message, left.Status) < 
       fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s/%s", right.Type, right.Message, right.Status)

// Use field-by-field comparison with early returns:
if left.Type != right.Type {
    return left.Type < right.Type
}
if left.Message != right.Message {
    return left.Message < right.Message  
}
return left.Status < right.Status
```

Example of early loop exit:
```go
// Add break to avoid unnecessary iterations
for _, r := range resources {
    if condition_met {
        bAllNeedPrune = false
        break  // Exit early once condition is found
    }
}
```

Consider the algorithmic impact of your implementation choices, especially when dealing with collections or repeated operations that could affect system performance at scale.
