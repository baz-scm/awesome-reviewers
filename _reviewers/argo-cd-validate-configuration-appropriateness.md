Ensure configurations are contextually appropriate and properly validated for their intended use case. This includes verifying that configuration options are suitable for the target resource type, handling configuration state transitions correctly, and choosing appropriate dependencies.

Key considerations:
- Validate that configuration options are relevant for the target resource (e.g., scaling actions should not be applied to DaemonSets since they operate on NodeSelectors)
- Handle configuration state transitions properly, including checking current state before making changes
- Prefer official, well-maintained dependencies over personal forks when possible

Example of proper configuration validation:
```lua
function toggleAutoSync(obj)
    if obj.spec.syncPolicy and obj.spec.syncPolicy.automated then
        -- Check current state before transition
        if obj.spec.syncPolicy.automated.enabled then
            obj.spec.syncPolicy.automated.enabled = false
        else
            obj.spec.syncPolicy.automated = nil
        end
    end
end
```

This practice prevents configuration mismatches, reduces runtime errors, and ensures that settings are applied appropriately for their intended context.
