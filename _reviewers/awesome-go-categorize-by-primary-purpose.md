When organizing configuration tools, environment management utilities, and settings-related projects, classify them based on their primary function and intended use case rather than their implementation details or secondary benefits. This ensures clear, consistent categorization that helps developers quickly identify the right tools for their configuration needs.

For example, a dependency injection library that uses reflection should be categorized under "Dependency Injection" rather than "Reflection" because dependency injection is its primary purpose. Similarly, when documenting configuration management tools, focus on what they primarily accomplish (environment management, config file handling, feature flags) rather than the underlying technology they use.

This approach prevents confusion and maintains logical organization where developers can intuitively find tools based on what they need to accomplish, not how the tools work internally. Apply this principle when creating configuration documentation, tool recommendations, and project categorization within your development environment.
