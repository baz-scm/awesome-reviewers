Code should adhere to the recommended Go style guidelines as outlined in the official Go Code Review Comments. While perfect adherence isn't always required, aim for minimal golint issues and follow established Go conventions for naming, formatting, and code organization.

High-quality Go code typically follows these standards naturally, and requiring this adherence helps filter out packages where insufficient care was taken in code quality. For existing, well-established packages, some flexibility may be acceptable, but new code should strive to follow these guidelines closely.

Consider using automated tools like golint or services like goreportcard.com to validate style compliance, though remember that these tools provide suggestions rather than absolute requirements. The goal is readable, idiomatic Go code that follows community standards.
