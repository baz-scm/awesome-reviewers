Maintain consistent usage of the Axios library throughout your Typescript codebase. Pay special attention to the following:

1. **Consistent Error Handling**: Ensure all Axios requests have proper error handling, such as using try/catch blocks to handle network errors, timeouts, and invalid responses. Provide clear and actionable error messages to aid debugging.

2. **Axios Configuration Options**: Leverage Axios configuration options like `timeout`, `headers`, and `baseURL` to ensure consistent behavior across your application. Avoid hardcoding these values in multiple places.

3. **Axios Request Patterns**: Use the appropriate Axios request methods (e.g. `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`) consistently based on the HTTP verb required by the API. Avoid mixing request types for the same endpoint.

4. **Axios Response Handling**: Extract and handle the response data consistently, whether it's accessing the `data` property or parsing the response body. Ensure error responses are also handled appropriately.

Provide code examples demonstrating best practices for the above Axios usage patterns to help developers write maintainable and robust Axios-based code.
