Follow consistent documentation formatting standards to improve readability and user experience:

1. Avoid second-person "you" usage in documentation as per style guidelines, preferring more direct instruction or third-person phrasing.

2. Format notes and important information using the standardized info emoji format for better visibility:

```md
> ℹ️ Note: For TypeScript users, `getDecorator` supports generic type parameters.
```

Instead of:

```md
> **Note**: For TypeScript users, `getDecorator` supports generic type parameters.
```

This creates visual consistency across documentation and makes important notes stand out to readers.
