        "comment_body": "@amnguye I see your point, my main thing is \"adding support for transferring hard links\" might be a little misleading since we are not actually creating a hardlink in the destination for phase 1 (only copying over as regular file) thus not FULL support. \r\n\r\nAs for softlinks, today if the customer tries to transfer a softlink, the transfer will fail (since you need to resolve the reference). So in phase 1 by skipping, we are kinda changing the behavior. (hardlinks and softlinks are only for NFS so customers should not be doing this today anyways).\r\n\r\nExactly how hard links and soft links are handled is documented already. I think this might be the best for the changelog:\r\n\r\n\"Added basic support for handling hard links and soft links in NFS Share-to-Share copy and Share-to-local download transfers.\"",
