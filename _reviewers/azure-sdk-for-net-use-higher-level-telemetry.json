If one was enabled, you use the Application Insights connection string, configure your Agents, and observe the full execution path through Azure Monitor. Typically, you might want to start tracing before you create an Agent.\n\nTracing also requires enabling OpenTelemetry support. One way to do this is to set the `AZURE_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_ACTIVITY_SOURCE` environment variable value to `true`.",
