Always maintain consistency in region configurations throughout your application. Instead of hardcoding endpoints, use proper region configuration which allows for better maintainability and fewer errors. When working with region-dependent services like S3, ensure your client configuration region matches the service requirements.

For example, when creating S3 buckets:

```python
# Good practice: Configure region once and use it consistently
region_name = 'us-west-2'
s3_client = boto3.client('s3', region_name=region_name)

# When creating a bucket, use the same region in LocationConstraint
s3_client.create_bucket(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    CreateBucketConfiguration={'LocationConstraint': region_name}
)
```

Remember that configuration sources have precedence - programmatic configurations (like client parameters) will override environment variables and config files. When multiple configuration sources exist, be explicit about which one takes precedence to avoid unexpected behavior.
