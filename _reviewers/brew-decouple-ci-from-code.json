So if we drop macOS 12 support here then it immediately drops macOS 12 CI from Homebrew/core even when we haven't tagged yet. This is a problem because `brew install` on unbottled formulae will start failing on macOS 12 until they get the tag (and auto-update interval is now 24 hours).\r\n\r\nWe should probably separate them as while they happen typically around the same time they probably shouldn't necessarily be at the exact same minute. It should be: drop macOS 12 from brew, tag and then drop macOS 12 CI.\r\n\r\nThey used to be separate but we combined them last year and later noticed this quick-tag situation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSimilarly, but less importantly, we can probably mark macOS 15 as supported slightly before we enable it for all Homebrew/core PRs - we can probably do so when the few SDK-tied formulae are bottled (so soon after we do pkg-config etc for Intel) given older bottles will work fine for the rest.
