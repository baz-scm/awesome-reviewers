Both tests where successful but with the system prompt it was very exact and it worked at first try, without it felt like it struggled a bit, but that's just my \"vibe\", I would leave it there with the \"or scroll by one page if no num_pages is specified\" removed part. It will improve weaker models especially... I think.",
