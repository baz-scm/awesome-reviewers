When implementing functionality, evaluate whether simpler algorithmic approaches or more appropriate data structures can achieve the same result with less complexity. Look for opportunities to eliminate unnecessary conditional branching, use built-in operations for common tasks, and leverage established patterns like regex for pattern matching.

Common simplifications include:
- Using set operations for merging collections instead of overwriting: `list({*existing_items, *new_items})`
- Eliminating conditional branches by providing sensible defaults: `scroll_amount = int(window_height * (params.num_pages or 1))`
- Replacing complex matching logic with regex patterns: `["deepseek-reasoner", "deepseek-r1", "gemma.*-it"]`

Before implementing complex logic, ask: "Is there a simpler way to achieve this using standard algorithms, data structures, or library functions?" This approach typically results in more maintainable, readable, and efficient code.
