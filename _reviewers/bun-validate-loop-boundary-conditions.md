When implementing iterative algorithms, ensure comprehensive handling of edge cases and boundary conditions. This includes:

1. Using while loops instead of if-else chains for repetitive operations
2. Explicitly handling overflow/underflow scenarios
3. Validating both start and end conditions
4. Testing with boundary values

Example - Before (problematic):
```zig
if (strings.endsWith(normalized_name, "/")) {
    normalized_name = normalized_name[0 .. normalized_name.len - 1];
} else if (strings.endsWith(normalized_name, "\\")) {
    normalized_name = normalized_name[0 .. normalized_name.len - 1];
}
```

Example - After (robust):
```zig
while (strings.endsWith(normalized_name, "/") or 
       strings.endsWith(normalized_name, "\\")) {
    normalized_name = normalized_name[0 .. normalized_name.len - 1];
}
```

This approach prevents issues like:
- Missed cases in chained conditions
- Integer overflow/underflow in calculations
- Incomplete processing of repeated patterns
- Boundary condition errors

When implementing iterative algorithms, always consider:
1. What happens at zero/empty input?
2. What happens at maximum values?
3. Can the operation need to be repeated?
4. Are all edge cases handled explicitly?
