This provides a `chef_node` object in InSpec profiles containing all attributes from the Chef Infra Client including Ohai configuration attributes.\n\n#### Compliance Phase Inputs Attribute\n\nIn 2019 we renamed InSpec attributes to inputs to avoid confusion between InSpec attributes and Chef Infra attributes. Compliance Phase is now updated to use the updated inputs name. Instead of passing `node['audit']['attributes']` you can now use `node['audit']['inputs']`. Don't worry about rushing to update your code though because Compliance Phase will still work with the existing attributes, giving you time to migrate to the new name.\n\n### Secrets Manager Integration\n\nWe've updated our beta secrets management integration helper to make it easier to fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault. We'd still love to hear from you if you are integrating Chef Infra with a secrets management system or you'd like to do so in the future. E-mail us at secrets_management_beta@progress.com.\n\n#### Simpler Azure Key Vault Names Declaration\n\nThe `secrets` helper has been updated to allow specifying the Azure Key Vault to fetch a secret from within the name instead of using the config hash:\n\n**Specifying the Vault in the Name**\n\n```ruby\nsecret(name: \"test-chef-infra-secrets/test-secret-1\", service: :azure_key_vault)\n```\n\n**Specifying the Vault in the Options Hash**\n\n```ruby\nsecret(name: \"test-secret-1\", service: :azure_key_vault, config: {vault: \"test-chef-infra-secrets\" })\n```\n\n#### AWS Default to Node's Region in AWS Secrets Manager\n\nWhen fetching secrets from AWS Secrets Manager the `secrets` helper will now default to fetching secrets from the region where the node resides.
