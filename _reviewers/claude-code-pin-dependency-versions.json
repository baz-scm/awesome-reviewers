Compromising the repository of the used action means it would be trivial for the threat actor to move laterally into this repository.\n\nI understand the ergonomics might not be great having to manually update the hash every time you update the beta tag. Perhaps a better solution would be to figure out some sort of automation to update the hash?\n\nI've got some ideas for setting that up if interested.",
