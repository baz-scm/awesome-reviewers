Before adding nullable casts or special null handling logic, verify whether the type or context already provides the necessary nullability semantics. This prevents redundant operations and ensures appropriate handling of different type categories.

When working with generic code, check if types are already nullable to avoid unnecessary casts:
```cpp
// Instead of redundant casting:
SELECT _CAST(__table1.`v.String`, 'Nullable(String)') AS `variantElement(v, 'String')`

// Recognize when the subcolumn is already Nullable(String):
SELECT __table1.`v.String` AS `variantElement(v, 'String')`
```

For generic functions handling different types, consider special cases for pointer types which have inherent null semantics:
```cpp
// Add conditional logic for pointer types:
if constexpr (!std::is_pointer_v<T>)
    LOG_INFO(getLogger("Jemalloc"), "Value for {} set to {} (from {})", name, value, old_value);
// Special handling needed for const char* and other pointer types
```

This approach reduces code complexity, improves performance by eliminating unnecessary operations, and ensures type-appropriate null handling across different contexts.
