Wrap operations that can fail in try/catch blocks to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the application or leaving it in an inconsistent state. This is especially important for file operations, API calls, and critical initialization code.

Operations that commonly need error handling include:
- File system operations (reading, writing, deleting files)
- Network requests and API calls
- JSON parsing and data serialization
- Extension activation and initialization
- Async operations that might throw

Example of adding error handling to extension activation:
```typescript
export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    try {
        // Extension initialization code that might fail
        await initializeExtension(context)
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to activate extension:", error)
        // Handle gracefully or show user-friendly error
    }
}
```

Example of adding error handling to file operations:
```typescript
async function deleteTaskWithId(id: string) {
    try {
        if (id === this.cline?.taskId) {
            await this.clearTask()
        }
        // File deletion operations that can fail
        await fs.unlink(apiConversationHistoryFilePath)
        await fs.unlink(uiMessagesFilePath)
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error deleting task files:", error)
        // Handle cleanup or notify user
    }
}
```

Without proper error handling, exceptions can be lost, operations can fail silently, or the entire application can crash unexpectedly. Always consider what can go wrong and provide appropriate error handling with meaningful error messages.
