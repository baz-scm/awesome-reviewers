Consolidate related configuration settings into dedicated config objects or files rather than scattering hardcoded values throughout the codebase. Separate different types of configuration (API endpoints, timeouts, credentials) into distinct config sections to improve maintainability and avoid coupling.

Use environment variables for sensitive data like API keys and DSNs instead of hardcoding them. Organize configuration with clear separation of concerns - for example, having separate `mcpBaseUrl` and `apiBaseUrl` rather than reusing the same URL for different purposes.

Create centralized configuration objects for related constants:

```typescript
// Instead of scattered constants
const DEBUG_PORT = 9222
const TIMEOUT_MS = 4000
const DEFAULT_RETRIES = 3

// Use centralized config
const browserConfig = {
  debugPort: 9222,
  timeoutMs: 4000,
  defaultRetries: 3
}

// Separate API configurations
const apiConfig = {
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL || "https://api.example.com",
  mcpBaseUrl: process.env.MCP_BASE_URL || "https://mcp.example.com"
}
```

Move shared configuration to dedicated config files in shared folders, and provide sensible defaults for all configuration values to ensure robust fallback behavior.
