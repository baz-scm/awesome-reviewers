This simplified having to deal with assets in ClineProvider, but I want your take - what's the best approach to adding SVGs in the webview? Surely we'll need to figure out a better way, but am not sure what will work best. I know gitlens uses their own icon pack font they register as part of the extension. ",

This is for publicly hosted assets in Microsoft's marketplace where they are concerned about security of the images being loaded from 3rd party domains or files that can be updated to be malicious later.  Microsoft requires SVGs specifically to not be loaded and hosted in these areas because of their nature of being able to execute code while being loaded.",
