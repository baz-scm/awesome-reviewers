Currently, it's placed quite early in the document, right after the initial introduction and before the \"Get Started\" section.\r\nI suggest moving it after the \"Features\" section and before the \"Shortcuts\" section. Here's why:\r\nThe current flow goes: Introduction \u2192 Release Process \u2192 Get Started \u2192 Features \u2192 Shortcuts\r\nA more logical flow would be: Introduction \u2192 Get Started \u2192 Features \u2192 Release Process \u2192 Shortcuts\r\nThis reorganization would:\r\nKeep all user-focused content (getting started, features) together at the top\r\nGroup the more technical/development-focused content (release process, shortcuts) together\r\nCreate a better progression from basic to advanced information\r\n\r\nSection moved.",
