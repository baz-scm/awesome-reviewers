When code elements become complex—whether functions performing multiple operations or data structures with multiple attributes—they require proper documentation to aid understanding and maintenance. Complex functions should include docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and behavior. Data structures should document their attributes and types for clarity.

For example, a function like `load()` that processes configurations, validates schemas, builds services, and merges data should have a comprehensive docstring:

```python
def load(config_details):
    """
    Load and process configuration files into service dictionaries.
    
    Args:
        config_details: Tuple containing working directory and config objects
        
    Returns:
        List of processed service dictionaries ready for deployment
        
    This function handles configuration preprocessing, validation,
    service building, and config merging for multi-file setups.
    """
```

Similarly, classes like ConfigDetails and ConfigFile should document their attributes and types to ensure consistent usage across the codebase. This practice becomes especially important when the team lacks consistent documentation standards—establishing clear documentation for complex elements helps maintain code quality and developer productivity.
