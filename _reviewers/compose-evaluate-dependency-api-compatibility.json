Also, not a _huge_ deal, but there's some API differences in the upstreamed implementations, most notably in the format for Windows recursive paths.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAll that said, I feel good about using upstream and pinning to a Git hash for now; that'll certainly make any future improvements more straightforward.",
