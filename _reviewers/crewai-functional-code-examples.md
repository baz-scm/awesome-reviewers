Ensure all code examples in documentation are complete, accurate, and ready to run without modification. Since developers frequently copy and paste examples directly into their projects, include all required parameters and follow consistent patterns.

For example, when demonstrating object creation:
```python
# Correct example with all required parameters
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest AI developments",
    expected_output="",  # Include mandatory parameters even if empty
    agent=researcher
)
```

Documentation structure should maintain consistent patterns across sections, explicitly listing required methods and parameters. This helps developers implement interfaces correctly and reduces the time spent debugging issues caused by incomplete examples.
