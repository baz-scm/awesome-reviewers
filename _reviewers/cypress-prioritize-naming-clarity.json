I decided to keep it because I could see stuff like this getting A/B tested down the line, which would introduce more variations, and it seems a little more clear to me if we imply that from the outset.",

Basically we just are avoiding writing `@packages/frontend-shared` and instead writing `@cy`, not sure if this is really that valuable.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear other thoughts, but I think it raises the complexity of the code base (hard to know where an alias points) for little to no actual value.",
