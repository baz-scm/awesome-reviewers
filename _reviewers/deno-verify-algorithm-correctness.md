Ensure algorithms produce expected results by validating data flow and checking that all execution paths return meaningful values rather than undefined or incorrect results. Pay special attention to conditional logic that filters or processes data, and verify that functions receive the necessary arguments to perform their intended operations.

For example, when implementing filtering logic, ensure all condition branches are properly handled:
```javascript
// Verify complex conditional logic covers all cases
((typeof listener.options === "boolean" &&
  listener.options === options.capture) ||
  (typeof listener.options === "object" &&
    listener.options.capture === options.capture)) &&
listener.callback === callback
```

Also validate that functions receive required data to avoid undefined results:
```javascript
// Ensure functions get necessary arguments for proper execution
function sniffImage(input) {
  // Pass required Uint8Array to algorithm
  return imageTypePatternMatchingAlgorithm(input);
}
```

Before merging, trace through algorithm execution paths to confirm they produce the intended outputs and handle edge cases appropriately.
