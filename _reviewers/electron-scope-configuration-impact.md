When implementing configuration settings, carefully consider and limit their scope to prevent unintended broad impact across systems or workflows. Configuration changes should be targeted and controlled rather than applied globally when only specific contexts require them.

For example, instead of enabling debugging for all pipelines:
```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG }}
```

Consider using conditional logic to scope the configuration:
```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: ${{ github.ref == secrets.DEBUG_BRANCH_NAME && secrets.ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG || '' }}
```

Similarly, when processing configuration-driven logic, implement safeguards to prevent excessive or uncontrolled behavior:
```javascript
// Add limits to prevent configuration from causing excessive operations
labels.push(versionLabel);
if (labels.length >= 5) {
  break;
}
```

This approach ensures configuration changes remain predictable and don't inadvertently affect unrelated parts of the system.
