Avoid unnecessary test maintenance overhead by eliminating duplicate test coverage and implementing automated test update mechanisms. When the same functionality is already covered by equivalent tests (e.g., end-to-end tests that exercise the same code paths), remove redundant test implementations rather than maintaining multiple versions. Additionally, design test assertions and output systems to support automated updates rather than requiring manual copy-paste workflows.

For example, instead of maintaining both JavaScript and Go plugin tests when "the API calls in each JavaScript plugin are forwarded through a Go plugin," keep only the more comprehensive end-to-end tests. Similarly, implement snapshot-style testing systems that can automatically update expected outputs rather than requiring developers to manually copy test results.

This approach reduces maintenance burden, prevents test drift between duplicate implementations, and allows developers to focus on meaningful test coverage rather than repetitive maintenance tasks.
