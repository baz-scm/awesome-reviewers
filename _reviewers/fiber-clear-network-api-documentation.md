Ensure networking-related API documentation and descriptions are specific, clear, and include concrete implementation details rather than vague or generic statements. This helps developers understand exactly what networking functionality does and how to implement it correctly.

Key practices:
- Use specific technical terms instead of generic descriptions (e.g., "Unix domain sockets via `ListenerNetwork`" instead of just "Unix socket support")
- Include parameter names and types in method signatures for clarity
- Provide accurate grammar and consistent terminology in descriptions
- Use proper technical capitalization (e.g., "HEAD request" not "head request")

Example improvement:
```go
// Instead of: "Head send a head request use defaultClient, a convenient method"
// Use: "Head sends a HEAD request using the `defaultClient`, a convenience method"

func (c fiber.Ctx) Writef(format string, a ...any) (n int, err error)
// Clear parameter naming: 'format' instead of generic 'f'
```

This ensures networking documentation provides developers with the precise information needed to implement network functionality correctly and securely.
