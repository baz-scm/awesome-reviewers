Break down large methods and extract repeated code patterns into smaller, focused methods or getters to improve readability and maintainability.

When you encounter large conditional blocks, complex logic, or repeated patterns, consider extracting them into well-named private methods or getters. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and modify.

**Examples of when to extract:**

1. **Large if/else blocks**: Instead of having complex conditional logic inline, extract it into descriptive methods:
```dart
// Before: Large conditional block
if (hasNewline) {
  // 20+ lines of complex logic
} else {
  // 15+ lines of different logic  
}

// After: Extract into focused methods
final Path path = hasNewline 
    ? _createMultilineIndicatorPath()
    : _createSingleLineIndicatorPath();
```

2. **Repeated patterns**: When the same logic appears multiple times, extract it into a reusable method:
```dart
// Before: Repeated pattern
auto data_host_buffer = HostBuffer::Create(
    GetContext()->GetResourceAllocator(), GetContext()->GetIdleWaiter(),
    GetContext()->GetCapabilities()->GetMinimumUniformAlignment());
auto indexes_host_buffer = 
    GetContext()->GetCapabilities()->NeedsPartitionedHostBuffer()
        ? HostBuffer::Create(/* same parameters */)
        : data_host_buffer;

// After: Extract into helper method
auto [data_host_buffer, indexes_host_buffer] = createHostBuffers();
```

3. **Complex conditions**: Extract boolean logic into descriptive getters:
```dart
// Before: Complex inline condition
if (widget.separatorBuilder != null && index.isOdd) {
  // logic
}

// After: Extract into getter
bool get hasSeparators => widget.separatorBuilder != null;
bool get isSeparator => hasSeparators && index.isOdd;
```

This practice reduces cognitive load, makes code self-documenting through method names, and creates natural boundaries for testing individual pieces of functionality.
