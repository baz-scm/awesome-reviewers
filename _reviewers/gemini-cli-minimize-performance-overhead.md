Reduce unnecessary overhead in performance-related code by creating reusable patterns and avoiding verbose implementations. This applies to both production performance monitoring and development workflows like testing.

For performance measurement, avoid repetitive timing logic by creating wrapper functions that encapsulate the boilerplate:

```javascript
// Instead of repeated start/end timing:
const authStart = performance.now();
await config.refreshAuth(settings.merged.selectedAuthType);
const authEnd = performance.now();
const authDuration = authEnd - authStart;

// Use a reusable wrapper:
trackStartupPerformance(async () => {
  await config.refreshAuth(settings.merged.selectedAuthType);
}, 'authentication');
```

In tests, minimize execution time by avoiding unnecessary delays. Use minimal wait times when async operations require synchronization:

```javascript
// Avoid: await wait(100); // Slows down test suite
// Prefer: await wait(1); // Minimal delay when needed
```

This approach reduces both runtime overhead in production code and development-time overhead in test execution, improving overall system efficiency and developer productivity.
