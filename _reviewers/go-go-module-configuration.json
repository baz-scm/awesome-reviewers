I felt keeping github.com/user was consistent with the rest of the content already there and would minimize confusion if the user hadn't already run `git init` + `git remote add origin ...`.\r\n\r\nTo both - I can add a line that explicitly states that the new project directory be created outside of the `GOPATH` and within a directory the user is comfortable with?
