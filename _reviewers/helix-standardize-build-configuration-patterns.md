Explicitly define and standardize build configuration patterns across the project to ensure consistent behavior and optimal performance. Use explicit build type declarations and separate configurations for development and release builds.

Key points:
1. Use explicit build type declarations (e.g., 'release' vs 'debug')
2. Separate development and production configurations
3. Consider performance implications of build options

Example:
```nix
# Good: Explicit build configuration
packages = eachSystem (system: {
  default = pkgs.callPackage mkHelix {
    cargoBuildType = "release";  # Explicit build type
    rustPlatform = stableToolchain;  # Production toolchain
  };
  
  # Debug build with development toolchain
  debug = pkgs.callPackage mkHelix {
    cargoBuildType = "debug";
    rustPlatform = devToolchain;
  };
});

# Avoid: Implicit or mixed configurations
packages = eachSystem (system: {
  default = pkgs.callPackage mkHelix {};  # Implicit build type
});
```

This pattern ensures clear separation between development and production builds, makes configuration intentions explicit, and helps prevent unintended performance impacts from build options.
