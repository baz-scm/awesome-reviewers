Documentation language should be precise, unambiguous, and clearly scoped to prevent misinterpretation while maintaining readability. Avoid open-ended terms that could be misunderstood or exploited, and use established terminology when dealing with legal, technical, or domain-specific concepts.

When writing documentation:
- Use precise, established terminology rather than vague language (e.g., "protected traits" instead of open-ended "traits")
- Clearly define scope and boundaries (e.g., "enforced by members of the hyprwm GitHub organization" rather than ambiguous "members")
- Remove unnecessary qualifiers that might create confusion (e.g., "harassment is unwelcome regardless of motivation" rather than "harassment about protected traits")
- Balance comprehensiveness with readability - include specific examples but use "including but not limited to" to indicate non-exhaustive lists

Example from legal documentation:
```
// Ambiguous - could be misinterpreted
"license does not hinder the ability of one to contribute to, or view the source code"

// Precise - clearly scoped
"license does not hinder the ability of any non-commercial entity to contribute to, redistribute or view the source code of the project"
```

This approach ensures documentation serves its intended purpose without creating loopholes or confusion for readers.
