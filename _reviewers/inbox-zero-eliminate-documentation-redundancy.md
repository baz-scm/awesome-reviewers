Documentation should be concise and avoid repeating the same information in multiple places. Redundant content confuses readers, makes maintenance more difficult, and can lead to inconsistencies when only one copy gets updated.

When maintaining markdown files, READMEs, implementation plans, or other technical documentation:

1. Check for duplicate information before adding new content
2. Consolidate similar sections into a single, comprehensive section
3. Use cross-references instead of duplicating information
4. Regularly review documentation to identify and eliminate redundancy

Example of documentation improvement:
```diff
# Project Setup Guide

## Getting Started
...

- # Redundant Docker instructions
- ```bash
- docker-compose up
- ```

## Official Docker Setup
...
```

By maintaining a single source of truth for each piece of information, documentation remains clearer, more maintainable, and more trustworthy for all developers on the team.
