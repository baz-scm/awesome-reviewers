Centralize configuration settings like dependency versions and feature flags at the workspace level rather than duplicating them across individual crate files. This reduces maintenance overhead, prevents inconsistencies, and simplifies dependency management.

In a Rust workspace:
- Define common dependency versions in the root `Cargo.toml`
- Configure feature flags at the workspace level when they apply to multiple crates
- Reference workspace configurations in individual crates using the `workspace = true` property

Example:
```toml
# Root Cargo.toml
[workspace.dependencies]
schema = { version = "1.0.0", features = ["v3"] }

# Individual crate's Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
schema = { workspace = true } # Inherits version and features automatically
```

This approach prevents situations where developers need to update the same dependency in multiple places or encounter unexpected behavior due to mismatched feature flags.
