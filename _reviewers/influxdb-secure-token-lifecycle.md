Implement comprehensive lifecycle controls for authentication tokens to maintain security throughout token creation, usage, and deletion processes. Essential practices include:

1. Special handling for privileged tokens (like admin/operator tokens) with appropriate restrictions and user feedback
2. Unique identifiers for each token to prevent duplication or reuse of token IDs
3. Proper validation of token deletion permissions with clear error messages
4. Explicit regeneration paths for tokens that cannot be directly deleted

Example implementation for special token handling:
```rust
if let Err(e) = client.api_v3_configure_token_delete(&token_name).await {
    match e {
        Error::ApiError { code, ref message } => {
            if code == StatusCode::METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED && message == "cannot delete operator token" {
                println!(
                    "Cannot delete operator token, to regenerate an operator token, use `influxdb3 create token --admin --regenerate --token $TOKEN`"
                );
            }
        }
        _ => return Err(e.into()),
    }
}
```

This approach prevents security vulnerabilities that could arise from improper token management while providing clear guidance to users when special procedures are required.
