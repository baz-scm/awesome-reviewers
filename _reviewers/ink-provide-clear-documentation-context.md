Documentation should include practical context, clear explanations, and appropriate examples to help users understand both what functionality does and when to use it. Avoid confusing technical jargon and provide concrete use cases.

When documenting APIs or features:
- Include use-case examples that show when and why someone would use the functionality
- Replace confusing technical descriptions with clear, practical explanations
- Add visual aids like screenshots or GIFs when showcasing functionality
- Provide code examples that demonstrate real-world usage

For example, instead of writing "This function is useful when your component needs to know the amount of available space it has before it can start rendering", write "This function is useful when your component needs to know the amount of available space it has. You could use it, for example, when you need to change layout based on the length of its content."

The goal is to make documentation immediately useful to developers by providing the context they need to understand not just how something works, but when and why they should use it.
