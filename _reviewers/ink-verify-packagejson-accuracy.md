Ensure that package.json configuration entries accurately reflect the actual project structure and include complete, working settings. Incorrect or incomplete package.json configuration can cause runtime failures and deployment issues.

Key practices:
- Verify that the `main` field points to the correct entry file path
- Include complete configuration objects rather than shortcuts (e.g., full Babel preset configurations with targets)
- Test package configuration in a clean environment before publishing
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout configuration files

Example of problematic vs. correct configuration:

```json
// Problematic - main points to wrong file
{
  "main": "index.js",  // but actual file is dist/index.js
  "babel": {
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-react"]  // incomplete, missing targets
  }
}

// Correct - accurate paths and complete configuration
{
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "babel": {
    "presets": [
      "@babel/preset-react",
      [
        "@babel/preset-env",
        {
          "targets": {
            "node": "current"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

Always validate that configuration entries work as intended in the target environment before committing or publishing.
