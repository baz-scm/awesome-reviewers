Identify and eliminate expensive operations in frequently executed code paths, particularly in packet processing and network handling contexts. Hot paths are code sections that execute repeatedly at high frequency, where even small performance penalties can significantly impact overall system performance.

Common expensive operations to avoid in hot paths include:
- Debug logging functions like trace_printk that have high overhead
- Complex system calls or lookups performed per-packet
- Expensive socket lookups that can be replaced with map-based approaches

Instead, use performance-optimized alternatives:
- Conditional compilation or runtime flags to disable debug operations in production
- Pre-computed maps or caches to replace expensive lookups
- Batch processing where possible

Example from eBPF packet processing:
```c
// Avoid: expensive lookup per packet
sk = bpf_skc_lookup_tcp(skb, tuple, tuple_len, BPF_F_CURRENT_NETNS, 0);

// Better: use map-based lookup
struct connection_info *conn = map_lookup_elem(&connection_map, &key);

// Avoid: debug logging in production hot path
#ifdef DEBUG_MODE
    printk("Processing packet from %pI4\n", &iph->saddr);
#endif
```

Profile and measure hot paths to identify bottlenecks, then prioritize optimizing the most frequently executed expensive operations first.
