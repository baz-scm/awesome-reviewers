        "comment_body": "Personally, I don't think we need to provide this sort of step-by-step instruction. Documentation should provide the right directions for people to find things, and trust people's ability to figure things out. \r\n\r\nIn other words, don't say \"click this\", \"click that\" unless absolutely necessary OR referring to a confusing system designed by someone else\r\n- If you have to give that kind of instruction, then it's a design problem (should be intuitive)\r\n- You should then raise it up to @0xSage @imtuyethan to find a design solution \r\n\r\n## Download Directions\r\n\r\nI would say Jan can be downloaded from: \r\n\r\n1. https://jan.ai (homepage)\r\n2. Github Releases page (give instructions on which architecture to choose)\r\n    - Intel Macs (i.e. choose Mac x86 dmg)\r\n    - Apple Silicon M1, M2, M3 Macs (i.e. Mac ARM dmg)\r\n\r\n## Which Package should I download?\r\nFor Mac installation, there's a lot of issues where people don't even know there is a difference between Intel Macs and Apple Silicon Macs. Documentation should cover this difference, and explain how to find out what architecture/processor type they are on\r\n\r\n- Processor type (i.e. \"About This Mac\")\r\n- RAM\r\n\r\nAfter that, we need to explain how M1, M2, M3 -> \"Choose ARM\". And \"Intel\" = \"Choose x86\". \r\nYou may need to link up with @hiento09 to verify package names, as I believe he is defining it in CI/CD. \r\n\r\n## RAM\r\nLocal Inference is very RAM-heavy. We should have some recommendations here for hardware minimum requirements. \r\n\r\nI would recommend linking to external Apple documentation for \"About This Mac\" (vs. writing our own). ",
