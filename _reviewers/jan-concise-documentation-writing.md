Write documentation that respects user intelligence by being concise and avoiding over-explanation of obvious concepts. Assume users are "lazy but smart" - they don't need explanations like "A thread title is a title of a thread" but do need clear directions to find what they need.

Avoid unnecessary step-by-step instructions like "click this, click that" unless referring to confusing external systems. Instead, provide the right directions and trust users' ability to figure out basic interactions.

Adopt a tone that is:
- Concise and matter-of-fact
- Not salesy or superfluous  
- Show don't tell

Example of what to avoid:
```markdown
### Setting Thread Title
A thread title acts as a name for your thread. It appears on the left side of the chat window, helping you easily navigate through your interactions.
```

Better approach:
```markdown
### Setting Thread Title
Thread titles appear on the left sidebar for easy navigation between conversations.
```

When writing installation guides, focus on essential information rather than obvious steps. Provide clear directions to download locations and system requirements, but don't walk users through basic file operations they already know.
