Remove unnecessary filler words and repetitive phrases that dilute clarity and assume reader incompetence. Avoid words like "essentially", "basically", "just", "simple", "easy", and repetitive phrases like "at a high level" appearing multiple times in close proximity.

Write directly and respect your reader's intelligence. Instead of hedging with filler words, state facts clearly and concisely.

**Bad example:**
```markdown
Deep Research, at a high level, is essentially a pipeline / tool chain through which a user would go through. The inner workings of this pipeline might vary from provider to provider, but we've done up a table for you to compare the results below.

At a high level, the pipeline would look something like this:

This approach makes documentation more professional, easier to read, and shows respect for the reader's technical competence. Focus on delivering information efficiently rather than cushioning it with unnecessary qualifiers.
