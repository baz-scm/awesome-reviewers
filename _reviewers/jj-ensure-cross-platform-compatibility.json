Is that not enough?\r\n\r\nSorry, I think I had a confusing typo in my original message (now fixed). `uv` is not the problem. `codespell`'s config is also in the `pyproject.toml`, and it's not smart enough to check parent directories (as far as I tested). We wouldn't want it to miss `co-located` just because we ran it from another dir, now would we \ud83d\ude06? Or `colour` \ud83d\ude40 ?\r\n\r\n> I think it's better to explicitly pass the path list, and not offer the possibility to pass it manually.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's best. I don't have a perfect option in mind.\r\n\r\nIf we care about Windows, it gets harder, both because of the issue of the shell and because I think Windows has stricter limits on the command-line length. Perhaps, even for windows, the thing to do is to use `bash` and `xargs` (xargs knows how to invoke `codespell` several times with subsets of files) here. But then, do we want a separate command for Windows users who don't have Git Bash in their path?\r\n\r\nOr we could not care about Windows for this command, or we could wait until a Windows user suggests an alternative.\r\n\r\nOr we could have the user worry about it, and not pass a file list ourselves.\r\n\r\nOr we could implement a smarter `codespell` wrapper in Rust and use a cargo [`xtask`](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask). Perhaps one of Rust's shell script libraries ([examples in the \"Tooling\" section](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask?tab=readme-ov-file#tooling)) reimplemented `xargs` for Windows. But is it worth it?\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, we can pick some one of the options, perhaps document the limitations, and then see how much it affects people and whether they have ideas for improvements.",

So I've modified the `skip` configuration to better match the `.gitignore` content.\r\nIt is not as good as using `jj file list` though, because we have to maintain a similar list as in `.gitignore`. OTOH it also  works just with `uv run codespell` for those who don't use `mise`. \r\nI'll try to see with a Windows developer if we can do better.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it works in any directory, but always scans the whole project. It supports passing some directories/files to scan, but only when called from the root of the project. And it doesn't scan the gitignored files.",
