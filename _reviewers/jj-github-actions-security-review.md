Always review GitHub Actions workflows for security implications before merging, particularly focusing on authentication mechanisms and credential handling. Understand what permissions like `id-token: write` grant and their potential attack vectors. Ensure secure defaults are explicitly configured, such as disabling credential persistence.

Key security considerations:
- Understand JWT token permissions and their scope: "It allows GHA actions to request a JWT token on behalf of your repository"
- Be aware of potential abuse scenarios: "Bad Guys could get a hold of it during an actual execution of this workflow"
- Explicitly disable credential persistence to prevent vulnerabilities: `persist-credentials: false`
- Use security scanning tools to identify configuration issues

Example of secure checkout configuration:
```yaml
- uses: "actions/checkout@v4"
  with:
    persist-credentials: false
    ref: "${{ (inputs.tag != null) && format('refs/tags/{0}', inputs.tag) || '' }}"
```

When implementing new authentication mechanisms, ensure team members understand the security model and document any special permissions required for maintainer approval.
