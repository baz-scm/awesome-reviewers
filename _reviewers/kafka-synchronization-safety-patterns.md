Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent deadlocks and race conditions in concurrent code. When designing thread-safe components, carefully consider lock ordering, avoid nested synchronization blocks that could cause deadlocks, and make mutable shared state thread-safe.

Key practices:
1. **Avoid nested locks**: Don't call methods that acquire locks while holding another lock, as this can lead to deadlock scenarios
2. **Make shared mutable state thread-safe**: Use proper synchronization for fields accessed by multiple threads
3. **Document concurrency assumptions**: Clearly specify which methods are thread-safe and which require external synchronization
4. **Use appropriate synchronization primitives**: Choose between synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, or other mechanisms based on the specific use case

Example of problematic code:
```java
// Dangerous: calling acquisitionLockTimeoutTask.run() within synchronized block
synchronized void completeStateTransition(boolean commit) {
    // ... other operations
    if (acquisitionLockTimeoutTask.hasExpired())
        acquisitionLockTimeoutTask.run(); // Could cause deadlock
}

// Dangerous: mutable public field accessed by multiple threads
public ClientInformation clientInformation; // Not thread-safe
```

Example of safer approach:
```java
// Better: avoid nested locks, handle synchronization explicitly
synchronized void completeStateTransition(boolean commit) {
    // ... state transition logic
    // Schedule task execution outside of synchronized block
}

// Better: provide controlled access to mutable state
private volatile ClientInformation clientInformation;
public synchronized void updateClientInformation(ClientInformation info) {
    // Controlled update with proper synchronization
}
```

Always analyze the potential for deadlock when acquiring multiple locks and consider whether operations can be restructured to avoid nested synchronization.
