Never expose security vulnerabilities in public issue trackers. Security issues require confidential handling to prevent exploitation before fixes are available. Use private reporting channels such as:

1. A dedicated security email address (e.g., security@project.org)
2. GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

When implementing security reporting processes:
- Follow CNCF security templates for standardized procedures (https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/main/project-resources)
- Create clear documentation on how to report vulnerabilities
- Establish a security response team with defined responsibilities

Example security.md section:
```markdown
## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via:
- Our dedicated security email: security@project.org
- GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature: [Project Security](https://github.com/organization/project/security/advisories/new)

Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability. The security team will respond acknowledging receipt of the report and outline the next steps in handling your submission.
```

This practice helps protect users while vulnerabilities are being addressed and follows security industry best practices.
