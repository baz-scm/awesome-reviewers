Prioritize code simplification by removing unnecessary complexity, avoiding duplication, and leveraging existing utilities. This improves readability and maintainability while reducing potential bugs.

Key practices:
- Remove redundant code patterns like unnecessary length checks before ranging over slices
- Eliminate code duplication by extracting common logic into functions or using loops
- Use existing library functions and utilities instead of reimplementing functionality
- Simplify conditional logic by removing unnecessary else clauses and nested structures
- Replace verbose constructs with more concise alternatives

Example of simplification:
```go
// Before: Unnecessary length check and duplication
if len(request.FirstAvailable) > 0 {
    for _, subRequest := range request.FirstAvailable {
        // process subRequest
    }
}

// After: Direct ranging (safe for empty slices)
for _, subRequest := range request.FirstAvailable {
    // process subRequest
}

// Before: Local variables for simple values
trueVal := true
spec.SetHostnameAsFQDN = &trueVal

// After: Use utility functions
spec.SetHostnameAsFQDN = ptr.To(true)
```

This approach reduces cognitive load, minimizes maintenance overhead, and makes code more self-documenting by removing unnecessary abstractions and leveraging well-tested standard patterns.
