When processing large arrays or data structures, implement chunked processing to avoid stack size limitations and optimize performance. Break operations into manageable chunks rather than processing everything at once.

**Key practices:**

1. Use appropriate chunk sizes (typically 100KB or less) when dealing with large binary data or strings
2. Choose the right collection operation for your use case:
   - Use `reduce()` when accumulating or combining values across collections
   - Use `map()` when transforming elements without combining them
   - Consider recursion for nested structures with appropriate base cases

**Example:**
```typescript
// Process large binary data in chunks to avoid stack overflow
async asString(): Promise<string> {
  const data = this.data ?? new Blob([]);
  const dataBuffer = await data.arrayBuffer();
  const dataArray = new Uint8Array(dataBuffer);

  // Need to handle the array in smaller chunks to deal with stack size limits
  let ret = "";
  const chunkSize = 102400;
  for (let i = 0; i < dataArray.length; i += chunkSize) {
    const chunk = dataArray.subarray(i, i + chunkSize);
    ret += String.fromCharCode(...chunk);
  }

  return ret;
}
```

Implementing chunked processing improves application stability by preventing stack overflows and can improve performance by managing memory more efficiently. This pattern is especially important when handling user-generated content, large API responses, or binary data operations.
