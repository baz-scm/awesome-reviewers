When documenting AI integrations, provide comprehensive examples that showcase all common initialization and usage patterns. Documentation should include:

1. All initialization methods (direct constructor, `.fromDocuments`, etc.)
2. Links to related components and services
3. Complete usage examples with different options
4. Adherence to standardized documentation templates

For example, when documenting a vector store integration:

```javascript
// Show direct initialization
const vectorStore = new AIVectorStore(new SomeEmbeddings());

// Also show initialization from documents
const documents = [new Document({ pageContent: "text" })];
const vectorStoreFromDocs = await AIVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  documents,
  new SomeEmbeddings()
);

// Demonstrate common operations
const results = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("query", 5);
```

This practice ensures developers can quickly understand and implement AI integrations without needing to search through multiple documentation pages or source code.
