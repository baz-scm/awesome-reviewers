For example, to start a [Fetch](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) server, the command is:\n+\n+    ```bash\n+    uvx mcp-server-fetch\n+    ```\n+\n+    `uvx` is included with `uv` in the Langflow package.\n+    To use `npx` server commands, you must first install an LTS release of [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).\n+    For an example of starting `npx` MCP servers, see [Connect an Astra DB MCP server to Langflow](/mcp-component-astra).\n+\n+    To include environment variables with your server command, add them to the **Env** field like this:\n+\n+    ```bash\n+    ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=AstraCS:...\n+    ```\n+\n+    :::important\n+    Langflow passes environment variables from the `.env` file to MCP, but not global variables declared in the UI.\n+    To add a value for an environment variable as a global variable, add it to Langflow's `.env` file at startup.\n+    For more information, see [global variables](/configuration-global-variables).\n+    :::\n+\n+3.

In the **Tool** field, select the server tool you want the component to use.\n+The available fields change based on the selected tool.\n+For information on the parameters, see the MCP server's documentation.\n+\n+5. In the **MCP connection** component, enable **Tool mode**.\n+Connect the **MCP connection** component's **Toolset** port to an **Agent** component's **Tools** port.\n+\n+    The flow looks similar to this:\n+    ![MCP connection component](/img/component-mcp-stdio.png)\n+\n+6. Open the **Playground**.\n+Ask the agent to summarize recent tech news. The agent calls the MCP server function `fetch` and returns the summary.\n+This confirms the MCP server is connected, and its tools are being used in Langflow.",

Add the **MCP connection** component to your workflow.\n+\n+2. In the **MCP connection** component, in the **MCP Command** field, enter the command to start your MCP server. For example, to start a [Fetch](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) server, the command is:\n+\n+    ```bash\n+    uvx mcp-server-fetch\n+    ```\n+\n+    `uvx` is included with `uv` in the Langflow package.\n+    To use `npx` server commands, you must first install an LTS release of [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).\n+    For an example of starting `npx` MCP servers, see [Connect an Astra DB MCP server to Langflow](/mcp-component-astra).\n+\n+    To include environment variables with your server command, add them to the **Env** field like this:\n+\n+    ```bash\n+    ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=AstraCS:...\n+    ```\n+\n+    :::important\n+    Langflow passes environment variables from the `.env` file to MCP, but not global variables declared in the UI.\n+    To add a value for an environment variable as a global variable, add it to Langflow's `.env` file at startup.\n+    For more information, see [global variables](/configuration-global-variables).\n+    :::\n+\n+3. Click <Icon name=\"RefreshCw\" aria-label=\"Refresh\"/> to get the server's list of **Tools**.\n+\n+4. In the **Tool** field, select the server tool you want the component to use.\n+The available fields change based on the selected tool.\n+For information on the parameters, see the MCP server's documentation.\n+\n+5. In the **MCP connection** component, enable **Tool mode**.\n+Connect the **MCP connection** component's **Toolset** port to an **Agent** component's **Tools** port.\n+\n+    The flow looks similar to this:\n+    ![MCP connection component](/img/component-mcp-stdio.png)\n+\n+6. Open the **Playground**.\n+Ask the agent to summarize recent tech news. The agent calls the MCP server function `fetch` and returns the summary.\n+This confirms the MCP server is connected, and its tools are being used in Langflow.",
