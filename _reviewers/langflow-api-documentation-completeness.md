Ensure API documentation provides comprehensive, accurate information including limitations, complete workflow examples, and proper cross-references. API documentation should clearly state what endpoints do, what they don't support, their constraints, and how they fit into larger workflows.

Key requirements:
- Document API limitations explicitly (e.g., "Tools are not supported yet", "Advanced parsing processes only one file")
- Provide complete workflow examples with JSON payloads showing the full request-response cycle
- Include cross-references to related API endpoints and documentation sections
- Accurately describe API capabilities without overstating functionality
- Specify parameter constraints and dependencies clearly

Example of complete API workflow documentation:
```json
// Upload file first
POST /api/v1/files
// Then use file_path in flow
{
  "tweaks": {
    "File-qYD5w": {
      "path": ["returned_file_path"]
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures developers have all necessary information to successfully integrate with the API without encountering unexpected limitations or missing steps in their implementation.
