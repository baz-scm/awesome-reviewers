To open Langflow, navigate to your server's public IP address, such as `http://5.161.250.132`.\n Your address must use `http`, because you haven't enabled HTTPS.\n 8. To enable HTTPS, modify your domain's A record to point to your server's IP address.\n For example:\n-```\n-Type: A\n-Name: langflow\n-Value: 5.161.250.132  (your server's IP address)\n-```\n+    ```\n+    Type: A\n+    Name: langflow\n+    Value: 5.161.250.132  (your server's IP address)\n+    ```",

Start your server.\r\n\r\n        When users visit your domain, Caddy recognizes the incoming traffic and automatically routes it to your server with a secure, encrypted connection.\r\n~~~",
