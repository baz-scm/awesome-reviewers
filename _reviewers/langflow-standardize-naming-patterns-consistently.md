Establish and follow consistent naming conventions for similar types of elements throughout the codebase and documentation. When multiple instances of the same type of element exist, ensure they follow the same naming pattern to avoid confusion and improve maintainability.

For documentation placeholders and variables, standardize on a single format (e.g., `$VARIABLE_NAME` vs `VARIABLE_NAME`) and apply it consistently across all documentation. For section headers and labels, ensure the naming accurately reflects the scope of content - use plural forms when covering multiple items and singular when covering a single concept.

Example issues to avoid:
```markdown
# Bad: Inconsistent placeholder formats
--url "http://LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/run/FLOW_ID"
--header "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY"

# Good: Consistent placeholder format
--url "http://$LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/run/$FLOW_ID"  
--header "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY"

# Bad: Inaccurate scope naming
## Component menu  (when describing multiple menus)

# Good: Accurate scope naming  
## Component menus (when describing multiple menus)
```

This prevents confusion for users and developers, and makes the codebase more professional and maintainable.
