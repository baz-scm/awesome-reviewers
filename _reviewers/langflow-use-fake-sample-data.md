Always use completely fictional personal information in sample files, documentation, test data, and code examples to prevent privacy violations and unintentional exposure of real people's data. Real names, email addresses, phone numbers, and social media profiles should never appear in sample data as they can link to actual individuals and create privacy risks.

Example of what to avoid:
```
Emily J. Wilson
Email: emilyjwilson@example.com
Phone: 555-789-0123
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/emilyjwilson
```

Instead, use clearly fictional data:
```
Jane Doe
Email: jane.doe@example.com
Phone: 555-000-0000
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/janedoe-sample
```

This practice protects individual privacy and prevents potential legal or ethical issues that could arise from using real personal information without consent.
