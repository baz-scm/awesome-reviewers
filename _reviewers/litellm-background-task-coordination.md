When working with background tasks in async applications, ensure proper task lifecycle management and coordination to prevent memory leaks, race conditions, and resource conflicts.

Key practices:
1. **Use asyncio.create_task for fire-and-forget operations** to avoid blocking the main execution flow
2. **Implement proper task cleanup** by having tasks remove themselves from tracking collections when complete
3. **Use controlled loop conditions** instead of `while True:` to allow graceful termination
4. **Prevent overlapping executions** by checking if a task is already running before starting a new one
5. **Always release resources in finally blocks** to ensure cleanup even when exceptions occur

Example implementation:
```python
# Global task tracking with automatic cleanup
BACKGROUND_TASKS = set()

async def start_background_operation():
    # Use create_task for non-blocking execution
    task = asyncio.create_task(background_health_check())
    # Add to tracking set and auto-remove when done
    BACKGROUND_TASKS.add(task)
    task.add_done_callback(BACKGROUND_TASKS.discard)

async def background_health_check():
    # Use controlled condition instead of while True
    while use_background_health_checks:
        try:
            # Perform work
            await perform_health_check()
        finally:
            # Always cleanup resources
            await cleanup_resources()
```

This approach prevents memory leaks from orphaned tasks, allows controlled shutdown of background operations, and ensures resources are properly released even when errors occur.
