Ensure documentation for AI/ML tools and libraries is precise, complete, and properly formatted. This includes being specific about tool references, providing complete command-line option formats, and using proper markdown formatting.

Key practices:
- Be explicit about tool sources and relationships (e.g., "data generated by `llama-imatrix`" instead of just "data in file")
- Show both short and long forms of command-line options (e.g., `--chunk | --from-chunk` instead of just `--chunk`)
- Use proper markdown formatting for links and references
- Ensure all relevant options and methods are documented completely

Example improvements:
```markdown
# Before
* `--imatrix` uses data in file as importance matrix
* `--chunk` to skip the first n chunks
* More information: https://github.com/example/repo

# After  
* `--imatrix` uses data in file generated by `llama-imatrix` as importance matrix
* `--chunk | --from-chunk` to skip the first n chunks
* More information is [available here](https://github.com/example/repo)
```

This ensures users have clear, actionable information when working with AI/ML tools and can easily understand tool relationships and usage patterns.
