Avoid hardcoding AI model-specific assumptions and instead design systems to be configurable across different model architectures, data types, and configurations. This ensures your AI systems can adapt to evolving model designs and support multiple model families without requiring code changes.

Key areas to make flexible:

1. **Data types**: Support multiple tensor types (bfloat16, float16, float32) rather than assuming a single type
2. **Model architecture parameters**: Use dynamic configuration based on model metadata rather than hardcoded layer counts or dimensions  
3. **Model-specific features**: Design abstractions that can handle different model formats (e.g., MLA vs non-MLA architectures)

Example of inflexible code:
```python
# Bad: Hardcoded for specific models
if model_name in ["llama-7b", "llama-8b"]:
    return CacheGenConfig(
        key_first_layers=10,
        key_second_layers=20, 
        key_third_layers=32,  # hardcoded total layers
        key_first_bins=32,
        # ...
    )

# Bad: Assumes specific data type
assert t.dtype == torch.float16  # Only supports fp16
```

Example of flexible code:
```python
# Good: Dynamic configuration based on model metadata
return CacheGenConfig(
    nlayers=model_config.num_layers,  # Use actual layer count
    kspecs=[
        QuantizationSpec(start_layer=0, end_layer=model_config.num_layers//3, bins=32),
        QuantizationSpec(start_layer=model_config.num_layers//3, end_layer=model_config.num_layers, bins=16),
    ],
    # ...
)

# Good: Support multiple data types
DTYPE_TO_TAG = {
    torch.bfloat16: 0,
    torch.float16: 1, 
    torch.float32: 2,
}
tag = DTYPE_TO_TAG[t.dtype]  # Handle any supported type
```

This approach ensures your AI systems remain maintainable and can easily support new model architectures as they emerge.
