Eliminate duplicate or redundant commands when setting up AI infrastructure, model serving, or ML library installations. Redundant commands create confusion, increase maintenance overhead, and can lead to unexpected behavior in AI workflows.

Common scenarios to watch for:
- Installing the same AI library multiple times (e.g., both `uv pip install vllm` and `uv pip install --upgrade vllm`)
- Duplicating Docker entrypoint commands when the base image already defines them
- Repeating model configuration parameters across different setup stages

Example of redundancy removal:
```bash
# Before: Redundant vllm installation
uv pip install vllm
uv pip install --upgrade vllm

# After: Single command achieves the same result
uv pip install --upgrade vllm

# Before: Redundant Docker entrypoint
docker run --entrypoint "/usr/local/bin/vllm" $IMAGE serve $MODEL_NAME

# After: Use existing entrypoint (when ENTRYPOINT is already ["vllm", "serve"])
docker run $IMAGE $MODEL_NAME
```

Always review AI setup scripts and configurations to identify and eliminate unnecessary command duplication, ensuring cleaner and more maintainable infrastructure code.
