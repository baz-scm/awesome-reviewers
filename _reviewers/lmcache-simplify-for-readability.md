Improve code readability by simplifying complex logic, using Pythonic idioms, and removing unnecessary code. Extract helper functions for complex conditions, avoid code duplication, and leverage Python's built-in features for cleaner code.

Key practices:
- Extract helper functions for complex boolean conditions instead of inline logic
- Use Pythonic idioms like `if not items:` instead of `items == []` (PEP 8)
- Leverage walrus operator `:=` to reduce redundant dictionary lookups
- Avoid code duplication by refactoring common patterns
- Remove commented-out code and unused imports - git tracks history
- Simplify repeated conditional checks with single variables

Example:
```python
# Instead of:
if self.save_only_first_rank and not self.metadata.is_first_rank():
    return

# Use a helper function:
def is_passive(self):
    return self.save_only_first_rank and not self.metadata.is_first_rank()

if self.is_passive():
    return

# Instead of:
if memory_objs == []:
    return

# Use Pythonic style:
if not memory_objs:
    return
```
