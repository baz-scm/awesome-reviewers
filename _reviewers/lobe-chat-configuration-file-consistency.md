Ensure configuration values are consistent and properly coordinated across all related files (docker-compose, .env files, initialization scripts, workflows, etc.). Verify that port mappings, environment variables, and tokens don't conflict between files, and provide fallback configurations for critical settings.

Key practices:
- Cross-reference port assignments between docker-compose and .env files to prevent conflicts
- When adding new environment variables, update all relevant files (.env.example, init scripts, docker-compose)
- Provide fallback tokens/credentials (e.g., use GITHUB_TOKEN as fallback when PAT is not available)
- Test configuration changes locally to catch startup issues early

Example from discussions:
```yaml
# Bad: Port conflict
ports:
  - '8000:8000'  # Conflicts with CASDOOR_PORT=8000 in .env

# Good: Use environment variable consistently  
ports:
  - '${CASDOOR_PORT}:${CASDOOR_PORT}'
```

```yaml
# Bad: No fallback
target_repo_token: ${{ secrets.PAT_FOR_SYNC }}

# Good: Provide fallback
target_repo_token: ${{ secrets.PAT_FOR_SYNC || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
