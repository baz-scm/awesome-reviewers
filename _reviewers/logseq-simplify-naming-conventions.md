Prioritize simple, enforceable naming conventions over complex guidelines that are difficult to follow consistently. When establishing naming standards, focus on what serves a clear purpose and can be realistically maintained by the team.

Rather than creating detailed, multi-part naming schemes that require constant enforcement, identify the most critical naming points and make those standards clear and simple. For example, instead of complex commit message formats, focus on descriptive pull request titles that serve the changelog.

Key principles:
- Choose fewer, more important naming rules over many detailed ones
- Document naming conventions explicitly to avoid reliance on "tribal knowledge"
- Tailor naming standards to their specific use case and audience
- Recognize that "naming things is hard, the less the better"

Example: Instead of enforcing detailed commit message conventions that aren't consistently followed, establish clear PR title guidelines since those titles will be used in changelogs and need to be descriptive for end users.

This approach leads to better compliance and more consistent naming across the codebase, as team members can actually follow and remember simpler standards.
