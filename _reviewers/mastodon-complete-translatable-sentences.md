Use complete sentences in translatable strings rather than breaking them into fragments, even if this results in some repetition. Sentence fragments make translation difficult or impossible for languages with different grammatical structures, and they provide insufficient context for translators.

When you need rich formatting within translatable text, use placeholder-based approaches with complete sentences rather than splitting the text:


This approach gives translators full context and flexibility to restructure the sentence according to their language's grammar while maintaining the desired visual formatting.
