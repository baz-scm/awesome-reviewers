Continuously optimize and maintain your CI/CD infrastructure to keep development velocity high while ensuring quality. Proactive maintenance prevents disruptions that can impact the entire team.

Key practices:
- Respond quickly to CI failures and outages to minimize disruption
- Regularly stabilize and optimize test infrastructure to reduce flaky tests
- Continuously improve build tools and linting configurations for better performance
- Standardize release processes with clear documentation and automation

For example, when adding a new release type like patch releases:

```markdown
### Releasing a patch version

A patch release could happen if there is a regression fix that could not wait for the monthly release cycle.

It goes like this:
1. [Specific steps for patch release]
2. [Build steps]
3. [Publishing steps]
```

Invest time in automating repetitive tasks in your CI/CD pipeline. This pays dividends through faster feedback cycles, reduced manual errors, and more time for feature development.
