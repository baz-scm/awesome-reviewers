When designing and implementing APIs, always provide comprehensive specifications that clearly document all endpoints, methods, parameters, and expected responses. This should include:

1. **Method and parameter definitions** - Document each endpoint with its HTTP method, required/optional parameters, and parameter types.

Example:
```
PUT: /v1/storage/{tenant}/{timeline}/{endpoint}/{path}
Parameters:
- tenant: string (required) - The tenant identifier
- timeline: string (required) - The timeline identifier
- endpoint: string (required) - The endpoint identifier
- path: string (required) - The relative file path
- data: binary (required) - The file content
Response: JSON object with status and operation details
```

2. **Lifecycle states and transitions** - For resources with complex lifecycles, document the possible states (e.g., Active, Deleted) and the API operations that trigger transitions.

3. **Service integration patterns** - When an API is used for service-to-service communication, document which service is responsible for initiating specific operations and how services should interact.

4. **Error responses and handling** - Include possible error codes, their meanings, and recommended client handling strategies.

Clear API specifications facilitate integration, prevent misunderstandings, and serve as essential documentation for both API producers and consumers.
