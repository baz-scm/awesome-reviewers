Proxy endpoints that forward requests to external services can be exploited by malicious actors if left unsecured. Always implement proper authentication, authorization, and destination validation for proxy endpoints, especially in production deployments.

Consider these security measures:
- Require authentication tokens or API keys
- Validate and whitelist allowed destination URLs
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Apply stricter security controls in production environments

Example of a potentially vulnerable proxy configuration:
```javascript
// next.config.mjs - Unsecured proxy
async rewrites() {
  const ret = [
    {
      source: "/api/proxy/:path*",
      destination: "https://api.openai.com/:path*", // Open proxy - can be abused
    }
  ];
}
```

Instead, secure the proxy with proper authentication and validation in your API route handlers, and consider environment-specific security controls for production deployments.
