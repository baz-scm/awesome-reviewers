When implementing Next.js components that rely on dynamic content (e.g. random values, current time), it is crucial to use proper boundary handling to avoid hydration errors and performance issues. Components that use non-serializable values like `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or crypto APIs must be wrapped in a Suspense boundary to ensure correct client-server rendering. Alternatively, for values only needed in the browser, you can use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to initialize and update the dynamic content safely. Remember that props passed between Server and Client Components must be serializable to prevent rendering mismatches.
