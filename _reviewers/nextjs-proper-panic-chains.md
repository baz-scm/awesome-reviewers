When implementing panic handlers, follow these critical practices to ensure robust error handling:

1. Register panic handlers as early as possible in your program to avoid race conditions in multi-threaded environments
2. Always chain new panic handlers with existing ones to preserve important error context
3. Use appropriate error type downcasting methods to extract meaningful error information

Example of correct panic hook chaining:

```rust
use std::panic::{set_hook, take_hook};

// Capture previous hook and chain it with your custom handler
let prev_hook = take_hook();
set_hook(Box::new(move |info| {
    // Your custom panic handling logic here
    handle_panic(info);
    
    // Call the previous hook to maintain the chain
    prev_hook(info);
}));
```

When handling error types in panic recovery:

```rust
// Prefer this approach for downcasting errors
.downcast_ref::<dyn Display>()

// Instead of this, which expects Box<Box<_>>
.downcast_ref::<Box<dyn Error + 'static>>()
```

Use `Any::downcast_ref` for borrowed references and `Any::downcast` when you need ownership of the error value. Implementing comprehensive panic handling helps create more resilient applications with better error reporting.
