When building Next.js components, it is crucial to implement robust error handling to ensure the stability and predictability of your application. Always explicitly check for error conditions before proceeding with normal execution flow.

For operations that may throw exceptions, such as API calls or data parsing, use `try/catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate fallbacks. Avoid implicit error handling, as it can lead to unpredictable behavior and make debugging more difficult.

Here's an example of how to handle errors in a Next.js component that processes data from an API:

```javascript
import ErrorDisplay from './ErrorDisplay';

function MyNextJSComponent({ data }) {
  try {
    // Check for errors in the API response
    if ('error' in data) {
      // Handle the error case appropriately
      return <ErrorDisplay error={data.error} />;
    }

    // Only proceed with normal processing if no error exists
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{data.title}</h1>
        <p>{data.content}</p>
      </div>
    );
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any unexpected exceptions
    return <ErrorDisplay error={error.message} />;
  }
}
```

By following this pattern, you can ensure that your Next.js components are resilient to errors and provide a better user experience for your application.
