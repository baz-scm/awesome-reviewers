When building Next.js applications that handle sensitive data, it's crucial to implement robust security measures to prevent data leakage and injection attacks. This reviewer provides guidance on best practices for securely handling data in Next.js:

1. **Sanitize User Input**: When rendering user-provided data in your Next.js components, always sanitize the input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Use specialized libraries like `serialize-javascript` or the `JsonLd` component from `react-schemaorg` instead of relying on `JSON.stringify()` alone.

2. **Taint Sensitive Data**: Leverage React's experimental `taintObjectReference` API to mark sensitive data objects. This will help you identify and extract only the necessary fields in your Server Components, preventing the entire sensitive object from being passed to the client.

3. **Set Appropriate Security Headers**: Ensure that security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) are set on the response, not the request. This will ensure the headers are properly applied and effective in protecting your Next.js application.

4. **Model Data Defensively**: Design your data models to exclude sensitive fields by default, reducing the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive information to the client.

By following these guidelines, you can build Next.js applications that securely handle sensitive data and protect against common security vulnerabilities.
