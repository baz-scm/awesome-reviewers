Ensure technical documentation is precise, accurate, and correctly formatted to prevent confusion and improve developer experience. Focus on these key aspects:

1. **Fix broken links and references**: Update outdated paths and ensure all links point to the correct documentation sections.
   ```diff
   - [memoized](/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#request-memoization)
   + [memoized](/docs/app/guides/caching#request-memoization)
   ```

2. **Correct syntax and formatting errors**: Verify code blocks have proper closing tags, backticks, and XML elements match correctly.
   ```diff
   - A provider using `useSearchParams()` without `<Suspense>, triggering CSR bailout
   + A provider using `useSearchParams()` without `<Suspense>`, triggering CSR bailout
   ```
   ```diff
   - </urlset>
   + </sitemapindex>
   ```

3. **Fix grammatical issues and missing words**: Review for missing words in comparisons and incorrect grammatical constructions.
   ```diff
   - This limits prefetching to routes the user is more _likely_ to visit, rather all links
   + This limits prefetching to routes the user is more _likely_ to visit, rather than all links
   ```
   ```diff
   - With PPR is enabled, a page is divided into...
   + When PPR is enabled, a page is divided into...
   ```

4. **Clarify technical behavior and limitations**: Explicitly state when features have specific constraints or behaviors.
   ```diff
   - Next.js will automatically determine the intrinsic width and height of your image
   + When using local images, Next.js will automatically determine the intrinsic width and height of your image
   ```

5. **Remove artifacts from documentation drafting**: Check for URLs or references from documentation creation tools.
   ```diff

   + [Disabled Prefetch](#disabled-prefetch)
   ```

6. **Add explanations for complex concepts**: Include sufficient explanations for technical concepts like caching behavior and component relationships.

Following these practices ensures documentation remains a reliable and frustration-free resource for developers.
