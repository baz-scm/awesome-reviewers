When implementing Next.js in your application, ensure that you are correctly using the framework's documented configuration options and patterns. Configuration in Next.js is handled in specific ways, and improper usage can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Verify the following:

1. **Use Documented Configuration Options**: Only use configuration options that are officially supported by Next.js. Refer to the Next.js documentation to identify the correct options for your use case, such as `compiler.define`, `devServer`, `i18n`, etc. Avoid using undocumented or non-existent options, as these may not be processed correctly.

2. **Properly Format Configuration Values**: Ensure that the data types of your configuration values match the expected types in the Next.js documentation. For example, boolean, number, and string values should be provided in the correct format, as shown in the example below:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  compiler: {
    define: {
      BOOLEAN_VALUE: false,
      NUMBER_VALUE: 123,
      STRING_VALUE: "hello world"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Test Configurations in Development**: Always test your Next.js configurations in a development environment before deploying to production. This will help you catch any configuration errors or unexpected behavior early in the development process.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Next.js implementation adheres to the framework's best practices and avoids common configuration-related issues.
