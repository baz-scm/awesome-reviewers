This workspace is small, but the process we're walking through will scale to any size workspace.\n+\n+![A workspace graph showing an application depending on three libraries.](/blog/images/2025-09-16/graph.avif)\n+\n+## Start with What You Know: Using Biome Without Nx\n+\n+Before thinking about Nx at all, let's see how far we can get knowing a little bit about Biome and a lot about the Node ecosystem.\n+\n+Looking at the [Biome getting started docs](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/), we need to:\n+\n+1. **Install the package**:\n+\n+```shell\n+npm install --save-dev @biomejs/biome\n+```\n+\n+2. **Create the root configuration** using their init command:\n+\n+```shell\n+npx @biomejs/biome init\n+```\n+\n+This creates a `biome.json` file at the root of our repo.\n+\n+3. **Run the linter**:\n+\n+```shell\n+npx @biomejs/biome lint\n+```\n+\n+Without thinking about Nx at all, we've successfully installed Biome and run a lint across our entire workspace. That's a good starting point, but in a monorepo, **we don't want to lint all files all the time**. We want to lint individual projects.\n+\n+## Using npm scripts\n+\n+Normally, to avoid writing long commands every time, we'd reach for npm scripts. Let's add this to our root `package.json`:\n+\n+```json {% fileName=\"package.json\" %}\n+{\n+  \"scripts\": {\n+    \"biome-lint\": \"biome lint\"\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Now we can run `npm run biome-lint` instead. But we're still linting the entire workspace.\n+\n+### Targeting Individual Projects\n+\n+Since our workspace uses npm workspaces, every project has its own `package.json`. We can add the same script to individual project package files:\n+\n+```json {% fileName=\"apps/biome-example/package.json\" %}\n+{\n+  \"scripts\": {\n+    \"biome-lint\": \"biome lint\"\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Now if we move into that directory and run `npm run biome-lint`, we're only linting that specific directory. When you run `biome lint` with no other options, it lints that directory and directories below it.\n+\n+## The Nx Integration you didn't realize was there\n+\n+Here's something you might not realize: **we've already started an Nx integration**. If you open Nx Console, you'll see that `biome-lint` is available as a target under the \"npm scripts\" area. Nx automatically incorporates npm scripts into available tasks.\n+\n+![Screenshot of Nx Console showing npm scripts available as targets](/blog/images/2025-09-16/npm-scripts.avif)\n+\n+So while `npm run biome-lint` works, we can also run this through Nx:\n+\n+```shell\n+npx nx biome-lint biome-example\n+```\n+\n+This gives us the exact same result. We can copy this script to other packages, like our navigation library, and suddenly we can run `biome-lint` on multiple projects individually.\n+\n+## Hold on, I'm not using npm workspaces!\n+\n+While npm workspaces are the default for new Nx workspaces, there's a long history of workspaces created before that. Those workspaces use `project.json` files for project configuration. While you won't be able to use npm scripts like in npm workspaces, you can still create a target in your `project.json` files:\n+\n+```json {% fileName=\"apps/biome-example/project.json\" %}\n+{\n+  \"targets\": {\n+    \"biome-lint\": {\n+      \"command\": \"npx @biomejs/biome lint {projectRoot}\"\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+You'll notice one small difference: `{projectRoot}` appended to the end of the command.

[Check out our video](/getting-started/why-nx) to learn more about what Nx is about.\n+Welcome to the official Nx documentation!\n \n-{% github-repository title=\"Star Nx on GitHub\" url=\"https://github.com/nrwl/nx\" /%}\n+## What is Nx?\n \n-## Core Features\n+Nx is a powerful, open source, technology-agnostic build platform designed to efficiently manage codebases of any scale. From small single projects to large enterprise monorepos, Nx is designed to **streamline your development workflows**, **reduce errors** and **dramatically reduce waste** by [saving engineering time](https://youtu.be/2BLqiNnBPuU) and cutting compute costs.\n \n-- **Run Tasks Efficiently**: Nx [runs tasks in parallel](/features/run-tasks) and orders the tasks based on the dependencies between them.\n-- **Distribute Tasks in CI**: Nx scales your CI by [distributing tasks](/ci/features/distribute-task-execution) across many VMs. Your CI is fast no matter how big your repository is.\n-- **Cache Locally & Remotely**: With [local](/features/cache-task-results) and [remote caching](/ci/features/remote-cache), Nx prevents unnecessary re-runs of tasks, saving you valuable dev time.\n-- **Split E2E Tests and Rerun Flaky Tests**: Nx [automatically splits](/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks) large e2e tests to distribute them across VMs. Nx can also automatically [identify and rerun flaky e2e tests](/ci/features/flaky-tasks).\n-- **Automate Dependency Updates**: if you leverage [Nx plugins](/concepts/nx-plugins) you gain additional features such as [code generation](/features/generate-code) and tools to [automatically upgrade](features/automate-updating-dependencies) your codebase and dependencies.\n-- **Make it Your Own**: Nx is highly customizable and extensible. Fine-tune it by [creating a plugin for your organization](/extending-nx/tutorials/organization-specific-plugin) or [creating a tooling plugin](/extending-nx/tutorials/tooling-plugin).\n+{% youtube\n+src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_4WMl-Fn0w\"\n+title=\"What is Nx?\"\n+width=\"100%\" /%}\n \n-<!-- - **Monorepo and Single Projects**: Nx supports both, monorepos as well as single-project (standalone) workspaces. -->\n+## How Nx solves scaling\n \n-Find out more about [why you should use Nx](/getting-started/why-nx) or browse our [features](/features).\n+Monorepos offer significant advantages. They reduce integration overhead between different software components, enabling faster cross-project changes, and improving code sharing and collaboration among teams. However, without proper tooling, as projects multiply, build times increase and management complexity grows, potentially negating the original benefits.\n \n-## Try Nx Yourself!\n+Nx solves this by **providing solutions along the way for each step**, whether it's [for local development](/features), [integrating with your editor](/getting-started/editor-setup), [making your AI assistant smarter](/getting-started/ai-integration) and [scaling CI runs](/ci/features).\n \n-{% side-by-side %}\n+## Start small, extend as you grow\n \n-```shell {% title=\"Create a new workspace\" %}\n-npx create-nx-workspace\n-```\n-\n-```shell {% title=\"Add Nx to an existing workspace\" %}\n-npx nx init\n-```\n-\n-{% /side-by-side %}\n-\n-Also, here are some recipes that give you more details based on the technology stack you're using:\n-\n-{% cards cols=\"2\" mdCols=\"4\" smCols=\"2\" moreLink=\"/recipes/adopting-nx\" %}\n-\n-{% link-card title=\"Add to Existing Monorepo\" appearance=\"small\" url=\"/recipes/adopting-nx/adding-to-monorepo\" icon=\"pnpm\" /%}\n-\n-{% link-card title=\"Add to Any Project\" appearance=\"small\" url=\"/recipes/adopting-nx/adding-to-existing-project\" icon=\"nx\" /%}\n+Nx is built in a modular fashion, allowing you to adopt as little or as much as you'd like at any moment in your development lifecycle. You can **start with just the core and add additional capabilities incrementally** as your needs grow and complexity increases.\n \n-{% link-card title=\"Migrate from Angular CLI\" appearance=\"small\" url=\"technologies/angular/migration/angular\" icon=\"angular\" /%}\n+**At the foundation is Nx Core**: a Rust-based, technology-agnostic task runner that builds a knowledge graph of your workspace, understanding project relationships and dependencies. This enables highly optimized and fast task execution regardless of technology stack. It runs `package.json` scripts in [TypeScript monorepos](/technologies/typescript/introduction) or Gradle tasks in [Java projects](/technologies/java/introduction).\n \n-{% link-card title=\"Import Projects into Your Nx Workspace\" appearance=\"small\" url=\"/recipes/adopting-nx/import-project\" icon=\"ArrowDownOnSquareStackIcon\" /%}\n+{% callout type=\"deepdive\" title=\"Running NPM Scripts\" %}",
