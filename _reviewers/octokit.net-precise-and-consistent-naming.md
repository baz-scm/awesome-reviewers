Names should clearly indicate their specific purpose and context, while maintaining correct capitalization of brand names and products. 

When naming variables, parameters, or targets:
1. Choose names that specifically describe their purpose and domain context
2. Use proper capitalization for brand names and products
3. Ensure names accurately represent their intended function

**Examples:**
- Use `GITHUBOWNER` instead of `GITOWNER` when specifically referring to GitHub operations
- Write `GitHub` not `Github` to maintain correct brand capitalization

This practice improves code clarity, reduces confusion about a variable's intended use, and presents a professional attention to detail in your codebase.
