When introducing new terminology or naming conventions, ensure consistency with existing patterns in the codebase while prioritizing clarity and universal understanding. Before adding new names, identifiers, or terminology, review existing usage patterns and adopt the established conventions. When multiple options exist, choose the most widely understood and universally applicable terms.

For example, when adding translations or interface text, check existing instances: "I saw that 'Associer' is the verb used in all other instances" and maintain that consistency. Similarly, when choosing between terminology options, select the "most universal way" that will be clear to the broadest audience.

This applies to variable names, method names, UI text, comments, and any other identifiers where consistency and clarity are important for maintainability and user understanding.
