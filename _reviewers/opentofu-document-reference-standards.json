        "comment_body": "I don't think we explicitly decided this and so it's just been informal, but: historically the pattern was to link to one or more pull requests that represent the work the changelog entry described, but when we introduced the idea of tracking issues for larger projects it became easier to create just one link to the tracking issue rather than many links to all of the PRs that happened because of it. A tracking issue is not the same thing as a feature request or bug report issue despite the fact that we use the same GitHub features for all three: a tracking issue is directly describing some specific work to be done, rather than a broad problem to be solved somehow.\r\n\r\nIn simpler cases where there's only one PR associated with a single enhancement/bug issue it's less clear to me what we ought to do. The PR is a direct description of what changed and so that feels most intuitive to me given that the changelog is a log of changes and the PRs should link to their corresponding issues anyway.\r\n\r\nBut in practice our issues tend to describe changes in more end-user-oriented terms, so I can see the argument that they might be the more useful reference if you just want to know what you can do now that you could not do before. \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\nWe should probably discuss this in a different setting so we can think about the tradeoffs together as a team. I would suggest we don't block this PR on this question since we can always edit the changelog before release of we decide to do something different.",
