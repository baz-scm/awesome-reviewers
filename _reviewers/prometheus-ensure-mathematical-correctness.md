When implementing or testing algorithms, ensure mathematical relationships and constraints are maintained throughout the computation. Test data should have plausible values that reflect real-world mathematical relationships, and algorithmic edge cases should be carefully handled to prevent mathematical inconsistencies.

Key areas to focus on:

1. **Test data consistency**: Ensure test values have plausible mathematical relationships. For example, if testing histogram data, the sum field should reflect realistic values based on bucket distributions rather than arbitrary numbers.

2. **Interpolation and extrapolation boundaries**: When algorithms involve interpolation or extrapolation (like counter increases), carefully choose test intervals and handle edge cases where extrapolation might produce invalid results (e.g., negative values for counters).

3. **Numerical precision awareness**: Be mindful of floating-point precision issues, especially in aggregation algorithms. Direct calculations may be more precise than incremental approaches for certain operations.

Example from histogram testing:
```
# Bad: Arbitrary sum value that doesn't match bucket distribution
h_test {{schema:0 count:34 sum:5 buckets:[2 4 8 16]}}

# Good: Sum value that reflects realistic bucket distribution  
h_test {{schema:0 count:34 sum:170 buckets:[2 4 8 16]}}
```

This approach helps ensure algorithms behave correctly under various mathematical conditions and produce results that maintain expected mathematical properties.
