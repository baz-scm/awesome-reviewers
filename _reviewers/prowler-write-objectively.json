This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to effectively use the mutelist feature to manage and prioritize security findings.\n+\n+## What Is the Mutelist Feature?\n+\n+The mutelist feature enables users to:\n+* **Suppress specific findings** from appearing in future scans\n+* **Focus on critical issues** by hiding resolved or accepted risks\n+* **Maintain audit trails** of muted findings for compliance purposes\n+* **Streamline security workflows** by reducing noise from non-critical findings\n+\n+## Prerequisites\n+\n+Before muting findings, ensure:\n+* Valid access to Prowler App with appropriate permissions\n+* A provider added to the Prowler App\n+* Understanding of the security implications of muting specific findings\n+\n+**Warning:** Muting findings does not resolve underlying security issues. Review each finding carefully before muting to ensure it represents an acceptable risk or has been properly addressed.\n+\n+## Step 1: Add a provider\n+\n+To configure mutelist:\n+\n+1. Log into Prowler App\n+2. Navigate to the providers page\n+![Add provider](../img/mutelist-ui-1.png)\n+3.
