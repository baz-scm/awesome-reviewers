Use an impersonal, objective tone in technical documentation. Avoid using second-person pronouns ("you") and subjective terms like "simple" or "easy" which make assumptions about reader knowledge.

Instead of:
```

Prefer:
```

```

Similarly, when describing functionality, avoid characterizing it as "simple" or "straightforward" as this can be discouraging to readers who may struggle with the concept. Rather than describing how complex or easy something is, focus on clear, factual descriptions of what the feature does and how to use it. This creates more inclusive, professional documentation that respects diverse experience levels.
