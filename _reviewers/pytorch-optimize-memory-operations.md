Minimize unnecessary memory operations to improve performance. This includes optimizing memory allocations, initializations, copies, and loop computations that access memory.

**Key optimization strategies:**

1. **Avoid redundant memory initialization:**
   When using intermediate buffers that will be fully populated, don't waste time zeroing memory unnecessarily:
   ```cpp
   // Inefficient: Zeroing memory that will be fully overwritten
   Tensor intermediate = at::zeros({size}, options);
   
   // Efficient: Use uninitialized memory when it will be fully populated
   Tensor intermediate = at::empty({size}, options);
   ```

2. **Use efficient copy operations:**
   Order matters in chained operations. Choose the sequence that minimizes intermediate copies:
   ```cpp
   // Less efficient: May create unnecessary temporary
   return data.clone().detach();
   
   // More efficient: Detach first, then clone
   return data.detach().clone();
   ```

3. **Leverage move semantics:**
   Use std::move when transferring ownership to avoid unnecessary copies:
   ```cpp
   // Avoid copying when transferring ownership
   tags_ = std::move(tags);
   ```

4. **Optimize loop computations:**
   Move invariant calculations outside inner loops to reduce redundant operations:
   ```cpp
   // Inefficient: Computing offset in inner loop
   for (const auto j : c10::irange(n)) {
     for (const auto i : c10::irange(m)) {
       auto offset = j * ldc + i;  // Computed repeatedly
       // Use offset...
     }
   }
   
   // Efficient: Pre-compute loop invariant
   for (const auto j : c10::irange(n)) {
     auto base_offset = j * ldc;
     for (const auto i : c10::irange(m)) {
       auto offset = base_offset + i;
       // Use offset...
     }
   }
   ```

Always question if memory is being allocated, initialized, copied, or accessed unnecessarily, as these operations are often performance bottlenecks in data-intensive applications.
