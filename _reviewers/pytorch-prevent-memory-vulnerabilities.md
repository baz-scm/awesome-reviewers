Ensure code is protected against memory-related security vulnerabilities by properly handling type conversions and resource management. When working with different integer widths (e.g., mixing 32-bit and 64-bit values), explicitly cast to the wider type before performing operations to prevent integer overflow. Similarly, when working with external APIs that require manual memory management (like Python C API), either use RAII wrappers or explicitly handle resource acquisition and release.

Example 1 - Safe integer width handling:
```cpp
// Unsafe: May cause integer overflow if large values
int64_t offset = blockIdx.y * rows_per_block_y;

// Safe: Explicit cast to int64_t prevents overflow
int64_t offset = static_cast<int64_t>(blockIdx.y) * rows_per_block_y;
```

Example 2 - Safe memory management:
```cpp
// Unsafe: No reference management for PyObject
PyObject* dict = ...;

// Safe option 1: Use RAII wrapper
py::object dict = ...;

// Safe option 2: Explicit reference management
PyObject* dict = ...;
// Use dict
Py_XDECREF(dict);
```
