When implementing algorithms that process large data structures or complex computational paths, prioritize opportunities for dead code elimination (DCE) and path optimization. Different initialization strategies (like build-time vs. runtime initialization) can dramatically affect which code paths are evaluated and optimized.

Consider the following factors in your algorithm design:

1. Identify conditional paths that could be eliminated early through proper initialization
2. Analyze the computational complexity impact of path elimination
3. Consider how initialization timing affects branch prediction and invocation paths

For example, in a system like Quarkus, build-time initialization enables more aggressive DCE:

```java
// With proper build-time initialization, conditional paths can be eliminated
public void processData(Data input) {
    // This entire branch might be eliminated during DCE if FeatureFlag
    // is evaluated at build time
    if (FeatureFlag.isEnabled("experimental")) {
        runExperimentalAlgorithm(input);
    } else {
        runStandardAlgorithm(input);
    }
}
```

Without effective DCE, the system must evaluate both paths at runtime, potentially increasing computational complexity and preventing optimization of method invocation from megamorphic to direct calls. Additionally, be mindful of transitive dependencies when initializing components, as these can introduce unexpected algorithmic complexities and execution paths.
