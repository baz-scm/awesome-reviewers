For the `test.rb` change, it seems reasonable to say that converting between `3600` seconds and `1.hour.to_i` is relatively simple. However in this case I have no idea what period of time `31556952` seconds is, so `1.year.to_i` actually helps me understand the value much faster.",

        "comment_body": "@skipkayhil I agree that using `to_i` is much easier to understand and I think that applies in all circumstances including the `test.rb` file even though that value is the easiest to understand without it. It was unclear to me on what basis the `test.rb` reversion's author originally determined that `1.hour.to_i` is \"not worth\" it for it to be removed.\r\n\r\nLooking at the git history more, I think I have a better idea of how this divergence occurred: there was a previous iteration of the config where `max-age` wasn't specified in production and so the require was removed: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/009f767ca7a63f90afede9e6ff2ef46d2f798be1 then at that point it made sense for the `test.rb` to be updated to match that especially if the calculation is simple. But then later `max-age` was added back to production with the require restored.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI was about to close this PR since it seemed like only a trivial difference, but I also found this point relevant from https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/c8c549750da40cd540ad1064b0b75e5b4e32d3f1:\r\n> More generally, we shouldn't require core extensions in one environment\r\nand not others, since applications with `config.active_support.bare`\r\nenabled could rely on them implicitly and exhibit inconsistent behaviour\r\nacross environments.\r\n\r\nRight now that principle is being violated by having the core extension required in development and production, but not test.",
