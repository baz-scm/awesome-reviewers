Ensure React components have all necessary state information before rendering and that lifecycle events don't cause unintended state interactions. Components should validate they have required data (like sizing information) before updating, and state changes should be carefully managed to prevent side effects.

When removing state updates, verify that components still receive essential information for proper rendering. For example, modal components need viewport size data even when not directly using it for layout calculations.

When adding state management to lifecycle events, consider all scenarios where the event might trigger to avoid unintended behaviors:

```javascript
// Before: Focus logic in onLayout can cause unintended selection
public void requestFocusFromJS() {
    requestFocusInternal();
    // This could trigger selection even when focus didn't actually change
}

// After: Explicitly manage the state dependency
public void requestFocusFromJS() {
    requestFocusInternal();
    hasSelectedTextOnFocus = true; // Clear intent for this specific case
}
```

Always investigate the root cause when component behavior changes between architectures, as missing state dependencies often manifest as subtle rendering or interaction issues.
