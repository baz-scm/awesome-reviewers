When implementing algorithms, especially in performance-critical paths like scroll handlers or layout methods, prioritize computational efficiency and avoid expensive operations. Consider algorithmic complexity and choose more efficient approaches when dealing with large datasets or frequently called methods.

Key strategies:
1. **Use efficient search algorithms**: Replace linear searches with binary search when data is sorted or can be organized efficiently
2. **Avoid expensive recomputations**: Reuse existing calculations and data structures rather than recreating them (e.g., use existing layout accessors instead of creating new layouts)
3. **Choose optimal data structures**: Use primitive collections to avoid boxing overhead and memory retention issues
4. **Implement early termination**: Add condition checks to avoid deep traversals or unnecessary processing

Example from scroll view optimization:
```java
// Instead of linear search through all children
for (int i = minIdx; i < contentView.getChildCount(); i++) {
    // Process each child...
}

// Consider binary search for better O(log n) complexity
// when dealing with sorted or organized data structures
```

This is particularly important for methods called frequently (scroll handlers, layout callbacks) or when processing large collections, where algorithmic improvements can significantly impact user experience.
