When implementing React components, it is important to ensure that variables are properly scoped and used throughout the component lifecycle. This reviewer provides guidance on best practices for managing variable declarations and usage in React code:

- Group related variable declarations together to improve code organization and readability.
- When using variables within React hooks like `useEffect`, explicitly list all dependencies to prevent subtle bugs related to variable capturing.
- For loop variables used in closures (e.g. event handlers), prefer block scoping to ensure the intent of the variable usage is clear.
- Ensure that the scope and purpose of variables used across different contexts (hooks, closures, JSX) is obvious to readers of the code.

Proper variable management is crucial for writing maintainable and bug-free React components. The provided code examples demonstrate correct usage patterns that align with these principles.
