Always use proper memory alignment for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations to maximize performance. When implementing vector operations:

1. Use platform-specific aligned memory allocation functions when available
2. Provide alignment hints in vector load/store instructions even on platforms that don't strictly require alignment
3. Define specialized aligned versions of memory operations that can take advantage of hardware features

**Example:**
```c
// Prefer this approach with platform-specific optimizations
#if HAVE_ALIGNED_ALLOC
    return aligned_alloc(alignment, size);
#elif HAVE_POSIX_MEMALIGN
    void* result = nullptr;
    posix_memalign(&result, alignment, size);
    return result;
#else
    #error "Platform doesn't support aligned_alloc or posix_memalign"
#endif

// For memory operations, leverage alignment hints when available
#ifdef TARGET_ARCHITECTURE_WITH_ALIGNMENT_HINTS
    // Define aligned versions that use hardware alignment hints
    case OP_LOADX_ALIGNED_MEMBASE:
    case OP_STOREX_ALIGNED_MEMBASE_REG:
#endif
```

Proper alignment can lead to dramatic performance improvements for vector operations (up to 295x faster for some SIMD comparison operations) by enabling hardware-specific optimizations and avoiding cache-line splitting.
