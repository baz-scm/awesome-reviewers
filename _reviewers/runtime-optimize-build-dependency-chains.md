When configuring build and test processes in CI/CD pipelines, ensure proper dependency chains with clear inputs and outputs to avoid unnecessary execution steps and cross-platform failures. Use techniques like:

1. **Explicit dependencies between build targets** - Define clear dependency relationships to ensure components are built in the correct order

2. **Up-to-date checks** - Implement input/output dependency tracking to skip steps when source files haven't changed

3. **Cross-platform validation** - Verify that file references and environment variables work across all target platforms and architectures

For example, when setting up build targets in MSBuild:

```xml
<Target Name="ExecuteGenerateTests"
        Inputs="$(MSBuildAllProjects);$(SourceFiles)"
        Outputs="$(GeneratedTestListFile)"
        DependsOnTargets="BuildPrerequisites">
  <!-- Command that generates test files -->
</Target>

<Target Name="CompileGeneratedTests"
        BeforeTargets="BeforeCompile;CoreCompile"
        DependsOnTargets="ExecuteGenerateTests">
  <!-- Include generated test files in compilation -->
</Target>
```

This approach ensures that tests are only regenerated when source files change, dependencies are built in the correct order, and builds work consistently across different platforms, resulting in faster and more reliable CI/CD pipelines.
