Removing a key is SDK-defined, either with a remove_extra function or by passing nothing as data.\r\n\r\nComparing with this spec, what I get is that on methods which set a single key of context, remove* should remove a single key (worded: \"Removing **a key** is SDK-defined\". The specifically mention \"**a key**\"). On the other hand, when having methods that set the whole context at once, without a key, the remove* method should clear the whole context (worded: \"Removing **user data** is SDK-defined\", as opposed to \"**a key**\"). \r\n\r\nWDYT?",
