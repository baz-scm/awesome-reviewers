When implementing caching solutions, clearly document and justify your caching strategy decisions based on access patterns, performance requirements, and complexity trade-offs. Consider whether the benefits of complex caching approaches outweigh simpler alternatives.

For cache duration decisions, align TTL with content characteristics - static assets can use longer durations (days/weeks), while dynamic data may need shorter periods. For cache loading strategies, evaluate whether preloading provides sufficient performance benefits over on-demand caching to justify the additional complexity.

Example from the discussions:
```go
// Good: Justified preload strategy with clear reasoning
func (r *ClickHouseReader) PreloadMetricsMetadata(ctx context.Context, orgID valuer.UUID) ([]string, *model.ApiError) {
    // Preload all metrics metadata to avoid redundant ClickHouse queries
    // for each metric name lookup, trading memory for query performance
    
    // Good: Appropriate cache duration for static web assets  
    cache := middleware.NewCache(7 * 24 * time.Hour) // Static builds don't change
}
```

Always question whether additional cache keys or complex strategies provide measurable benefits over simpler approaches. Document the reasoning behind your caching decisions to help future maintainers understand the trade-offs made.
