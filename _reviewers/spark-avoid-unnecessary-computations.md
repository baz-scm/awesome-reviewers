Prevent performance degradation by avoiding unnecessary expensive operations such as premature execution, redundant iterations, and costly data conversions. Use lazy evaluation, short-circuiting, and efficient data handling patterns to optimize execution paths.

Key strategies:
- Use `lazy val` for expensive computations that may be accessed multiple times during plan transformations to avoid repeated evaluation
- Implement short-circuiting in conditional logic to skip expensive calculations when conditions aren't met
- Avoid converting between data types unnecessarily, especially expensive operations like UTF8String â†” String conversions
- Prevent premature execution of child operations during plan analysis phases
- Use single-pass iterations instead of multiple passes over collections

Example of lazy evaluation:
```scala
// Instead of:
val orderExpressions: Seq[SortOrder] = orderChildExpressions.zipWithIndex.map { ... }

// Use:
private lazy val orderExpressions: Seq[SortOrder] = orderChildExpressions.zipWithIndex.map { ... }
```

Example of short-circuiting:
```scala
// Instead of always computing both:
if (left.maxRows.isDefined && right.maxRows.isDefined) {
  val leftMaxRows = left.maxRows.get
  val rightMaxRows = right.maxRows.get
  // ...
}

// Use short-circuiting:
val leftMaxRowsOption = left.maxRows
val rightMaxRowsOption = if (leftMaxRowsOption.isDefined) right.maxRows else None
```

This approach reduces computational overhead, improves response times, and prevents unnecessary resource consumption during query planning and execution.
