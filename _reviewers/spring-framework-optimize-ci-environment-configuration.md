When configuring CI environments, carefully evaluate whether default dependency versions are sufficient for your project needs before adding custom installation steps. Default configurations (like Travis CI's JDK version) often provide adequate support while maintaining optimal build times. Only include additional installation commands when specific project requirements demand newer or different versions.

Example in Travis CI configuration:
```yaml
language: groovy
jdk:
  - oraclejdk8  # Default JDK 8 may be sufficient (e.g., JDK 8u65)

# Only add custom installation steps when default versions are inadequate:
# before_install:
#   - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

This approach ensures your CI pipeline remains efficient while still meeting all project requirements. Document any custom configuration decisions to help team members understand why defaults were overridden.
