When documenting performance metrics, benchmarks, or scalability information, prioritize clarity and conciseness. Avoid redundant wording, use consistent terminology when listing features, and structure information in a scannable format. Clear performance documentation helps developers understand system capabilities, set appropriate expectations, and make informed optimization decisions.

Example:
```diff
- The proposed workloads are designed to demonstrate Supabase Realtime's throughput and scalability capabilities. These benchmarks focus on core functionality and common usage patterns.

- This guide explores the scalability of Realtime's features: Broadcast, Presence performance, and Postgres Changes.

Clear performance documentation is critical for performance optimization efforts as it establishes baseline expectations and provides the context needed for future optimizations.
