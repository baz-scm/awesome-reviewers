Does it really make sense to pass full client cert chains (keeping in mind that they've already been validated here)? If not, should we maybe copy this struct and clear some of the larger and less useful fields?\r\n\r\n`TLSSubject.Names` is probably not useful since the common ones are parsed into the fields above it (and of course everyone only uses CommonName)\r\n\r\n`TLSConnection.State.PeerCertificates`, `VerifiedChain`, etc. could be quite large and probably were not intended to be encoded as JSON\r\n\r\nDo you have an example of what a typical value looks like in JSON for TLS and non-TLS?\r\n",
