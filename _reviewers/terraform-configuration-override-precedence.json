We already something close, where we filter the tests in the config. Doing this backend validation is however not possible at the moment due to import cycles. Given that, this approach should be sufficient for now. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the crux of the problem is because the `TestSuiteRunner` implementation is defined within the `backend` package. That was a time when tests were supposed to be limited in-memory local backend. With the advent on non-local backends, we should move it out, and thus would allow us to reference backend \"parent\" packages like the `init`. However, that may not need to be part of this PR\r\nI moved that functionality into the moved test suite like I described here => https://gist.github.com/dsa0x/b076bc35f53226594496b51cc93e5670 (see `ensureBackend`)",

At that point it made sense for the TestSuiteRunner to be in the local package as it has similar responsibilities to the local backend (a backendrun.OperationsBackend), i.e. it coordinates how the test operation is executed locally.\r\n\r\nI think a potential solution for this is to separate the \"local\" backendrun.OperationsBackend from the \"local\" backend.Backend, with the state backend in another package. That would help prevent backend/init from importing backend/local, and maybe -hopefully- could allow the validation to be done during parsing and neither after parsing nor at the point of test execution.\r\n\r\nI'll try my idea out as I have some pre-existing work doing the above already.

The run options are a 1:1 mapping to actual run options a user can specify on the command line to the plan command, and overriding the state is not something that can be done this way. I think putting it here confuses things.\r\n\r\nI think we can actually just have it at the root level of the `run` block. It's metadata about the run block rather than something that changes the behaviour of the plan/apply operation itself.",

This is necessary because, if the `override_*` block does not explicitly set a value for `override_during`, the global value should be applied. However, if the override_* block does set a value, it should take precedence over the global value. Using a pointer allows us to differentiate between an explicitly set value and a zero value.",
