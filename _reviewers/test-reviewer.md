Handle errors explicitly with proper TypeScript types and avoid silent failures.

When working with TypeScript, leverage the type system to create robust error handling patterns that catch issues at compile time and provide clear runtime error management. Avoid using `any` types or ignoring potential error states that can lead to production failures.

Essential TypeScript error handling practices:

**Define Custom Error Types**: Create specific error classes that extend the base Error class. This provides better error identification and handling throughout your application.
