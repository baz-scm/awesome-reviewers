Implement consistent algorithms for type compatibility and comparison across different data structures. When developing type checking logic, ensure similar operations (like assignment compatibility, intersection, or mapping) behave predictably regardless of the underlying type structure.

For example, when handling tuple types versus object types:

```typescript
// Ensure consistent behavior between these patterns
// Rest parameter tuple compatibility
type RestTuple = (x: string, ...args: [string] | [number, boolean]) => void;
const handler = (a: string, b: string | number, c?: boolean) => {};
// Should be assignable with consistent rules

// Tuple intersection handling
type A = [number, number] & [string, string];
// Should be handled as position-wise intersection: [number & string, number & string]

// Object vs tuple mapped type behavior
type MappedObj<T> = { [K in keyof T]: T[K] };
type MappedTuple<T extends any[]> = { [K in keyof T]: T[K] };
// Should follow consistent inference patterns
```

Pay special attention to:
1. Ensuring type compatibility algorithms handle tuples and objects with equivalent logic
2. Applying the same principles when intersecting different data structures
3. Implementing safeguards against circular references that can cause inconsistent state or crashes
4. Caching intermediate results properly to avoid recomputing complex type relationships

This consistency leads to more predictable type system behavior and fewer edge cases for developers to navigate.
