When documenting configuration objects and their parameters, provide clear explanations of each parameter's purpose, whether it's required or optional, and why optional parameters are useful for development. Use backticks to format code symbols, parameter names, class names, and error types for better readability.

For example, when documenting configuration like:
```python
context=ProcessorConfig(
    verbose=True,        # Optional: enables detailed logging for debugging
    work_dir="local-working-dir",  # Required: working directory for pipeline
    reprocess=True,      # Optional: forces reprocessing of existing files
    re_download=True,    # Optional: forces re-downloading of source files
)
```

Explain that `verbose`, `reprocess`, and `re_download` are optional parameters that make development easier by providing debugging information and forcing fresh processing during iterative development.

In documentation text, wrap configuration-related terms in backticks: "Sets minimum version of `unstructured-client` to avoid raising a `TypeError` when passing `api_key_auth` to `UnstructuredClient`"
