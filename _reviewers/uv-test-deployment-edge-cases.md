Ensure that code paths handling different deployment environments (installation prefixes, target directories, etc.) have proper test coverage. Without tests for these scenarios, it's difficult to trust that the functionality works correctly across all supported environments.

For example, if your code handles different installation paths like:

```python
def find_binary_path():
    targets = [
        # The scripts directory for the base prefix
        sysconfig.get_path("scripts", vars={"base": sys.base_prefix}),
        # Above the package root, from `pip install --prefix`
        _join(_parents(_module_path(), 4), "bin"),
        # Adjacent to the package root, from `pip install --target`
        _join(_parents(_module_path(), 1), "bin"),
    ]
    # ...
```

You should add tests that verify the function works correctly in each deployment scenario. Consider simulating these environments in your test setup:

1. Create test fixtures that mimic different installation structures
2. Test with platform-specific path patterns when needed (e.g., Windows vs. Unix)
3. Ensure test suites appropriately fail (rather than skip) when environment configuration is missing or incorrect

This reduces the risk of deploying code that only works in the development environment but fails in production scenarios.
