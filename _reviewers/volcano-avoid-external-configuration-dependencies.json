And the MIG profiles requested by Pod are also annotated as annotation entries. That's not how annotation is meant to be used this way. Can we define a CRD to manage these specs and status, and node can refer to this CRD? Or we can aggregate these specs and status into one JSON struct and annotated as only one annotation entry.",
