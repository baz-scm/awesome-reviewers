Establish comprehensive validation for changesets to ensure reliable release automation. Changesets are required for all releasable artifacts, including internal refactors, as they drive the release process. Implement validation to enforce proper changeset format, meaningful descriptions, and correct semantic versioning.

Key requirements:
- All changes intended for release must include a changeset, even internal refactors
- Changeset types must be one of: major, minor, or patch (not custom types like "docs")
- Descriptions should be clear and specific, avoiding placeholders like "<TBD>"
- Version type selection should follow semantic versioning principles based on actual impact

Example validation in CI workflow:
```yaml
- name: Validate changesets
  run: |
    # Check changeset format and required fields
    pnpm changeset status
    # Validate no placeholder content
    ! grep -r "<TBD>" .changeset/
```

This prevents deployment failures, ensures consistent release notes, and maintains proper version semantics in automated release pipelines.
