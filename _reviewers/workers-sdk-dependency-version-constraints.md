Ensure consistent and appropriate dependency version constraints across all package.json files. Use flexible version ranges for peer dependencies to avoid forcing unnecessary upgrades, maintain minimum supported versions that align with project requirements, and keep template dependencies up-to-date for consistency.

Key practices:
- Use caret (^) syntax for regular dependencies: `"wrangler": "^3.101.0"`
- Use hyphenated ranges for peer dependencies when supporting multiple versions: `"vitest": "1.3.x - 1.5.x"`
- Specify minimum supported versions that match actual requirements, not outdated versions
- Classify dependencies correctly (dependencies vs devDependencies vs peerDependencies)
- Keep template package.json files updated to latest supported versions for consistency
- Consider using workspace references (`workspace:*`) for internal packages to maintain version alignment

Example of proper version constraints:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "wrangler": "^3.101.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "vitest": "1.3.x - 1.5.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@cloudflare/workers-types": "^4.20241230.0"
  }
}
```

This prevents compatibility issues, reduces maintenance burden, and ensures users can adopt newer versions without being blocked by overly restrictive constraints.
