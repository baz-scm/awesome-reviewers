Two reasons: firstly the environment variable used is `CLOUDFLARE_ENV`; secondly, once we start talking about 'Vite environments', the term 'Worker environments' is confusing as each Vite environment is also a Worker and could therefore be considered a Worker environment. No perfect solution here but hopefully this is better (have changed all the other references below).\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\n[Intro](#intro) | [Quick start](#quick-start) | [Tutorial](#tutorial) | [API](#api) | [Cloudflare environments](#cloudflare-environments) | [Migrating from `wrangler dev`](#migrating-from-wrangler-dev)\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
