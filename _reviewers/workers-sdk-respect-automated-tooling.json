Someone asked if the version would also get automatically changed by `changesets`. My guess was that it wasn't. Someone else said editing these files is fine. I took that to mean it's ok to manually bump the version in `package.json` so that it's in sync with `minor`.\r\n\r\nIs it the case that `changesets` will update the version number here even if I've changed from `patch` to `minor` in this PR?\r\n\r\n",
