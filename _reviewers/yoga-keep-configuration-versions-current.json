There was some unhappiness when I tried to bump from C++ 11 directly to 17.\r\n\r\nLLVM has had C++ 17 support for almost six years though, so I do plan for us to do a bump later this year. Same rules for same infra, and unlocking more support.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/facebook/yoga/pull/1203 for discussion",
