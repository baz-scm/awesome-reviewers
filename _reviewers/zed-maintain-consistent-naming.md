Ensure naming follows consistent patterns throughout the codebase in both style and structure:

1. Use agreed-upon case style for identifiers (e.g., snake_case for functions):
{% raw %}
```diff
- {{# if (hasTool 'grep') }}
+ {{# if (has_tool 'grep') }}
```
{% endraw %}

2. Maintain consistent ordering in hierarchical names, with namespaces coming first:
```diff
- export additional-language-server-workspace-configuration: func(...)
+ export language-server-additional-workspace-configuration: func(...)
```

3. For selectors and hierarchical identifiers, order components from less specific to more specific:
```diff
- (emphasis) @markup.emphasis
+ (emphasis) @emphasis.markup
```

This consistency improves code readability, makes the codebase more predictable, and reduces cognitive load when writing or reviewing code.
