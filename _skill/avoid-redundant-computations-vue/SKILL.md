# Avoid Redundant Computations (Vue)

Vue’s reactivity system can update frequently, so it’s vital to avoid doing the same expensive work multiple times. This skill focuses on identifying and eliminating redundant operations that cause slowness[12]:

- **Cache expensive results.** If a function’s result will be used repeatedly, compute it once and reuse it. For instance, avoid calling a transform like `camelize(key)` on the same value inside loops; store it in a variable first[3].
- **Compute only what’s necessary.** Don’t transform or iterate more data than needed. For example, instead of mapping every item in an array if you only need the first, process just that one item[13].
- **Lazy evaluation.** Postpone heavy calculations until they are actually needed. Use short-circuit logic or lazy initialization so that if a code path isn’t taken, the computation never runs[14].
- **Initialize with final values.** Whenever possible, instantiate data structures in their desired final state rather than creating empty and then pushing/adding. For instance, directly create an array with initial elements instead of creating an empty array and then pushing items[15].
- **Avoid unnecessary work in loops.** Use flags or parameters to skip work. In Vue’s internals, for example, passing a boolean flag to a function can prevent it from doing teardown work for each item in a loop when that work isn’t needed[16].

These optimizations particularly help in Vue applications where watchers or computed properties might otherwise recalc too often. By caching and being lazy, we reduce memory churn and CPU usage, keeping the UI responsive even as the app scales[17].
