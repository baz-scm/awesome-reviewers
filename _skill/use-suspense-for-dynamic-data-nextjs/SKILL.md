# Use Suspense for Dynamic Data (Next.js)

Next.js uses Reactâ€™s server-side rendering (SSR) and prerendering extensively. Components that produce non-deterministic output (e.g. rely on current time, random values, or request-specific data) must be handled carefully to prevent hydration mismatches. The best practice is to wrap such components in a `<Suspense>` boundary with a fallback UI[18]:

1. **Identify dynamic components.** Find components that cannot be fully rendered at build time because they depend on runtime data (user input, query results, etc.)[19].
2. **Wrap them in Suspense.** Use `<Suspense fallback={...}>` around those components. The fallback should be a loading state or placeholder that is displayed until the dynamic content is ready[19].
3. **Consistent fallback UI.** Ensure the fallback looks appropriate relative to the final content, so the user experience remains smooth during hydration. The goal is to avoid abrupt layout shifts or content flashes once the real data loads[19].

For example, in a Next.js page you might prerender a static title, but wrap a `<DynamicComponent />` that fetches data in a Suspense boundary with a spinner or placeholder[20]. This way, the prerendered HTML contains the fallback (avoiding a blank space), and React will seamlessly hydrate either the fallback or the real content when ready. Following this pattern leverages Next.js SSR benefits while ensuring no crashes or warnings due to mismatched content on hydration[18][21]. It improves both performance and reliability of your Next.js application.
