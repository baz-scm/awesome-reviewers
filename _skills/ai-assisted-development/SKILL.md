# AI-Assisted Development

AI is transforming how developers work. A large majority of developers are using or planning to use AI tools in their development process. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can generate code, write tests, and even help debug. The ability to effectively use these assistants is a new superpower – it can dramatically speed up routine tasks. However, developers must also critically review AI output because many still do not fully trust AI accuracy and see it struggle with complex tasks.

## Examples
- Using an AI pair programmer to generate a boilerplate module, then refining and optimizing that code manually.
- Asking an AI tool to explain a piece of code or suggest fixes for a bug, speeding up the debugging process while double-checking its suggestions.

## Guidelines
- **Embrace AI Tools:** Integrate AI assistants into your workflow for tasks like code generation, documentation drafting, and test case suggestions. These tools can significantly boost productivity for routine coding tasks.
- **Validate AI Output:** Always review and test code produced by AI. Treat AI suggestions as helpful drafts, not final solutions. It’s a critical skill to critique and improve AI-generated code – add missing error handling, fix inefficient logic, and ensure it fits your project’s style and requirements.
- **Stay in Control:** Use AI to augment your work, not replace your thinking. Be aware of known limitations (AI might produce insecure or incorrect code). Maintain rigorous quality practices (code reviews, tests) for AI-written code just as you would for human-written code to ensure reliability.
