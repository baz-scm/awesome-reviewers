# Full-Stack Development

Full-stack developers can build end-to-end applications, handling both the client-side and server-side. This is the most common developer role â€“ about one in three developers identifies as full-stack. Mastery of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript) and back-end technologies (server frameworks, databases) allows for building complete features independently. Modern tooling (e.g. Node.js) even enables using one language across the stack, improving efficiency.

## Examples
- Creating a web application with a React (front-end) and Node.js/Express (back-end) stack.
- Designing an API server and the accompanying front-end interface that consumes it.

## Guidelines
- **Front & Back Proficiency:** Build competency in both front-end (e.g. React or other JS frameworks) and back-end (e.g. Node.js, Python, Java) development. Most developers today are expected to span both areas in a **full-stack** capacity.
- **Unified Tech Stack:** Leverage technologies that allow sharing code or language between client and server. For example, using Node.js for server-side enables using JavaScript/TypeScript in both front-end and back-end, allowing real-time, scalable applications with a single language.
- **Integrate Databases & APIs:** Be comfortable designing database schemas and building RESTful or GraphQL APIs. Full-stack work often involves linking the UI to persistent storage and external services, requiring knowledge of SQL/NoSQL databases and API design best practices.
