# Collaboration & Open Source Contribution

Building software is usually a team effort. Strong collaboration skills – communicating with team members, reviewing each other’s code, and following shared conventions – are essential. Many developers also participate in open-source projects to share knowledge and improve their skills. Contributing to open source is recommended for new developers to gain experience and visibility. Ultimately, being able to work well with others (often asynchronously, across different time zones or via platforms like GitHub) is a key developer superpower.

## Examples
- Participating in code review: reviewing a colleague’s pull request and providing constructive feedback, as well as responding to feedback on your own code.
- Contributing a bug fix or new feature to an open-source project, following the project’s contribution guidelines and coding style.

## Guidelines
- **Code Review Mastery:** Engage in code reviews regularly. Read others’ code and provide helpful suggestions, and incorporate feedback from reviewers on your code. For example, if reviewers suggest a function be split for clarity, be willing to refactor. Code review culture leads to better code quality and knowledge transfer.
- **Open Source Engagement:** Consider contributing to open-source projects or internal company repositories. This exposes you to large-scale codebases and different perspectives. It’s also a great way to demonstrate skills. Always follow the project’s contribution guidelines when submitting changes.
- **Team Communication:** Maintain clear and professional communication with team members. Document decisions, update project artifacts, and respect established team conventions. By aligning with team processes, you build trust and velocity in development.
