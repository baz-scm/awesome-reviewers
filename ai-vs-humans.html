    <p class="lead">
      This page dynamically fetches <code>/assets/data/trends.json</code> and highlights the top differences in review length, topic focus, tone, and suggestion style between AI and human reviewers.
      The numbers come from thousands of real code review comments in popular open source projects&mdash;spanning more than fifteen languages and frameworks.
      Our dataset includes repositories like <em>Apache Airflow</em>, <em>Fastify</em>, and <em>Docker Compose</em>, each with its own vibrant contributor base.

      <p>
        Human reviewers devote roughly a third of their feedback to code style and consistency, often tying those comments to the bigger picture of project architecture.
        They also dive into testing, CI/CD processes, and documentation concerns far more than bots do.
        AI reviewers, on the other hand, spend the bulk of their comments on style rules and policy enforcement, rarely venturing into design discussions.

    <h2 id="tone-language">3. Tone &amp; Language</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Human reviewers</strong> soften feedback and frequently include context or rationale. Comments often start with polite words like <em>&ldquo;please&rdquo;</em> or qualifiers such as <em>&ldquo;nit:&rdquo;</em>.
        One maintainer explained: &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t set any kind of &lsquo;auto-fix&rsquo;. CI&rsquo;s role is to check everything is OK&hellip; not to replace the contributor doing things right.&rdquo;
        (<a href="https://awesomereviewers.com/reviewers/ci-cd/ci-philosophy-guidance">CI philosophy guidance</a>)
        This tone of mentorship and reasoning is a hallmark of human reviews.
      </li>
      <li><strong>AI reviewers</strong> are blunt, factual, and impersonal&mdash;no greetings or pleasantries.
        They will plainly state issues such as &ldquo;unused variable detected&rdquo; without explanation.
        (<a href="https://awesomereviewers.com/reviewers/code-style/lint-unused-variable">Lint bot unused-var check</a>)
        While efficient, this style lacks the nuance and back-and-forth that humans provide.
      </li>
    </ul>

        <div class="chart-title">% of Comments with Ready-Made Fix</div>
        <p class="statblock" title=""></p>
      </section>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI</strong>: roughly <strong>80&nbsp;%</strong> of its comments include a code suggestion you can apply with one click (for example Copilot&rsquo;s <code>suggestion</code> blocks).
        Bots never tire of offering these quick fixes, which streamlines the review cycle for simple issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Humans</strong>: about <strong>35&nbsp;%</strong> of human comments provide inline suggestion snippets.
        These are often wrapped with an explanation of <em>why</em> the change helps, giving maintainers extra context.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Consider extracting this into a helper to avoid duplication.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      AI-generated suggestions are fast and mechanical. Human suggestions, while less frequent, often include a short rationale or alternative approach that teaches the contributor along the way.

    <h2 id="real-world">5. Real-world Examples</h2>
    <p>
      Here are two short excerpts from our dataset that typify how humans and AI phrase their feedback.
    </p>
    <h3>Human-Driven Insight</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Could you move this to outside of <code>terminal-chat</code> as a standalone utility?</p>
      <footer><a href="https://awesomereviewers.com/reviewers/documentation/js-utility-refactor">JS utility refactor suggestion</a></footer>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="example-desc">This sort of polite nudge encapsulates how human reviewers often guide contributors toward cleaner architecture.</p>
    <h3>AI-Driven Nitpick</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[nitpick] Missing semicolon at end of line.</p>
      <footer><a href="https://awesomereviewers.com/reviewers/code-style/semicolon-enforcement">Auto-style semicolon check</a></footer>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="example-desc">Bots routinely catch tiny style issues like this and present them without additional commentary.</p>

    <h2 id="summary">6. Summary &amp; Takeaways</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>ðŸ§  <strong>Humans</strong> excel at <strong>contextual guidance</strong>, design discussions, and an overall empathetic tone. Their feedback often balances project goals with readability and maintainability.</li>
      <li>ðŸ¤– <strong>AI</strong> shines at <strong>consistency</strong>, <strong>scale</strong>, and <strong>one-click suggestions</strong> for trivial issues. Bots enforce rules with perfect recall but rarely understand intent.</li>
      <li>ðŸ’¡ <strong>Best practice</strong>: Layer AI-driven lint and security checks <em>before</em> human review. Let the automated tools catch mundane problems so maintainers can focus on the design decisions that matter.</li>
