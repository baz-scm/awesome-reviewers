        "You're right that the initializer inside `useState` only runs once per mount. However, in React’s Strict Mode (development only), it's **intentionally called twice** to detect impure logic. Since `registerTab` mutates internal state, calling it twice would incorrectly register the tab multiple times, shifting tab indices and breaking the selection or indicator logic.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we guard it with `hasRegisteredRef`, ensuring `registerTab` runs only once — even in development. In production, the guard has no effect because the initializer runs only once as expected.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the initializer should be pure (per [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice)), but we intentionally break that rule here to **support SSR** — specifically, to precompute tab metadata so that the correct tab is marked selected on the first render (see [test case](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/6c0f14b50dc7c86134b8bb549da47dc33bf8b06a/packages/mui-material/src/Tabs/Tabs.test.js#L901-L912)). Without it, we get hydration mismatches..\r\n\r\nI considered making `registerTab` idempotent, but that’s not feasible when we need to assign an implicit `value` based on the tab's render order. That requires incrementing a shared index counter (`childIndexRef`) — and we can’t require users to always provide explicit values to `Tab` without introducing a breaking change.\r\n\r\nThis approach strikes a balance: it ensures SSR correctness, avoids hydration issues, and works with wrapper components like `<Tooltip><Tab /></Tooltip>`, while remaining safe under React’s development behavior.\r\n\r\nOpen to suggestions if you think there's a cleaner way to achieve this.",
        "> If I understand it correctly this won't work well if you remove a tab dynamically (as there's no unregister function)\r\n\r\nIt won't. But it isn't supported even in latest version.\r\n\r\nThis PR: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ry4fan5c-t3b4771r\r\nMaster: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ry4fan5c-oqugmytq",
        "Yes, registering during the effect phase would prevent it from running on the server, which breaks SSR.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps we could register both during rendering and in an effect and make the register operation idempotent (or register conditionally if it hasn't been registered yet). This will allow the use of the unregister function in the effect cleanup.\r\n\r\nThat could work well only if tabs always have explicit `value` props. But in our case, we also support implicit values based on render order, like this:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst [tab, setTab] = React.useState(1);\r\n\r\nconst handleChange = (event, newValue) => {\r\n  setTab(newValue);\r\n};\r\n\r\nreturn (\r\n  <Tabs value={tab} onChange={handleChange}>\r\n    <Tab label=\"one\" />\r\n    <Tooltip title=\"two helper\">\r\n      <Tab label=\"two\" />\r\n    </Tooltip>\r\n  </Tabs>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, tabs derive their `value` from their render position (i.e., first tab = 0, second = 1), using an internal `childIndexRef`.\r\n\r\nIf we register both during render and in an effect:\r\n\r\n* In React Strict Mode (dev only), render and effect each run twice i.e total of 4 registrations.\r\n* Even without Strict Mode, a single tab would be registered twice. (one in first render and second in effect).\r\n\r\nSo, there would be 4 child indexes.\r\n\r\nWhile `registerTab` is already idempotent when used with explicit values (via `valueToIndex.has(finalValue)`), we can't enforce `value` on Tab without introducing a breaking change.\r\n",
        "> Deriving the value from the position sounds good to me 👍🏼\r\n\r\nThis logic was already present when `cloneElement` was used. Just picked that up here.\r\n\r\n> But if we create a `value` for the position on our side, then we would have a `finalValue`, no?\r\n\r\nYes, we do generate a `finalValue` based on position internally when value isn't provided. The issue is that this implicit value depends on render order and a shared index (`childIndexRef`), which is incremented during registration.\r\n\r\nIf we allow `registerTab` to run multiple times — as suggested above, in both render and effect — the index keeps increasing, and the same tab ends up with different `finalValue`s across renders. That breaks selection and causes hydration mismatches.\r\n\r\nWith explicit `value`, we don’t rely on index state, so idempotency is safe. But for implicit values, the act of generating `finalValue` is tied to mutable state — so calling `registerTab` multiple times isn’t safe unless we move to require explicit values, which would be a breaking change.",
        "I don't think this will work.\r\n\r\n> In any subsequent register call, we use `finalValue` to identify the Tab\r\n\r\nWhy do we want to pass the same `finalValue` to the next registration call? If we want to pass this stored `finalValue`, we shouldn't call `registerTab` again in the first place (supposedly in the effect).\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit the code if you have any ideas.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEven in Base UI, they are making the `value` prop required on Tab: https://github.com/mui/base-ui/pull/2124. \r\n\r\nSupporting implicit `value` in Tab cause them issues like https://github.com/mui/base-ui/issues/1880.",
        "> Because we want to return the unregistering callback from the effect, so it's run on unmount.\r\n\r\nBut wouldn't the useEffect's setup function do nothing? It would simply return the output given as an input **always** when doing `registerTab(finalValue)`.\r\n\r\n> This is not an option for us unless we want to wait for a new major.\r\n\r\nYes, not an option now.\r\n\r\n> We're already supporting implicit value, aren't we? With or without my suggestion.\r\n\r\nYes, we are already. Just wanted to point out some issues. I thought it would help us to understand.",

This is less important if we do the item above, but I wonder if it would make sense to separate this function. You could have 3 new functions, each in their own file that perform one of these checks. \r\nThen you could have a separate browser/node file that exports the same function.

We already have quite a few. And I don't think it necessarily warrants an additional enum and annotation attribute.\r\n\r\nAs it stands in the proposal, the addition of the two new enum constants in `ExecutionPhase` makes it impossible for a user to configure conflicting phases for a given `@Sql` declaration, and that's a good thing.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I have never heard any complaints from users about the `ClassMode` and `MethodMode` dichotomy in `@DirtiesContext`, and the documentation clearly states that setting an inappropriate mode \"has no meaning\" (i.e., will be ignored).\r\n\r\nIn light of that, I am OK with the PR as-is.",

Thus, we cannot actually detect a user configuration error.\r\n\r\nThe only way to be able to detect a user configuration error for `@DirtiesContext` would be to introduce new `DEFAULT` enum constants in `ClassMode` and `MethodMode` and use those as the `default` attribute values going forward.\r\n\r\nHowever, that would be a breaking change for any users who had inadvertently explicitly supplied the previous default values for those attributes.\r\n\r\nPlus, it would make things a bit more cumbersome.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, I don't think we should make any changes to `@DirtiesContext` in this regard this late in the game.\r\n"

However, `GcCutoffs.space` will be initialized with a non-zero value during tenant activation, before the PITR cutoff is computed. This means that we can't disambiguate an uninitialized PITR cutoff from one that falls below the timeline creation. As a consequence, once a timeline is e.g. 7 days old, it's PITR history size will suddenly jump from 0 to some large number.\r\n\r\nTo disambiguate the uninitialized case from the new timeline case, we'll need to change `GcCutoffs.time` from an `Lsn` to an `Option<Lsn>`. Does that sound good?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if we can't rely on the cache for PITR cutoff monotonicity, then any PITR window increase by the user will have a retroactive effect on billing (in the case where it actually takes effect for GC, which is currently only in the case of a tenant restart/migration). I just want to confirm that we're okay with that.",

I'll axe it.\r\n\r\nIf we did report it externally, then we could use it to enforce monotonicity in the billing system, which presumably _does_ have access to the previous value.

        "Ack, I'm sympathetic to that. This API is modeled more after the Pageserver's current capabilities than the compute's needs (see e.g. [`get_vectored`](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/cbf442292b44decf7ab7fff77658d81c51b2c93f/pageserver/src/tenant/timeline.rs#L1182-L1191) and [`get_rel_page_at_lsn_batched`](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/c1ff7db1874c6b5ff8ee134b944f1c54616ba37b/pageserver/src/pgdatadir_mapping.rs#L244-L252)). If the compute is only ever going to request contiguous page chunks at the same LSN then we can probably lean into that for optimization.\r\n\r\nHowever, this assumes that the compute can't make forward progress until the entire batch has been received. I'm not sure that's always true.\r\n\r\nLet's consider an extreme case, for illustration: we send a batch request for pages 0-100, and at page 50 we have to download a layer which takes 3 seconds. I think there are cases where it's advantageous to send back pages 0-49 first, and pages 50-100 later:\r\n\r\n* A different backend may request a single page 20, and block on the batch request.\r\n* Similarly, if the batch was a prefetch, we could eagerly populate the LFC with pages 0-49 before anyone requests them.\r\n\r\nHowever, this depends on where readers would get blocked. If the initial batch request holds a Postgres lock for the pages, then we can't unblock the waiters until we serve the entire initial batch request.\r\n\r\nAs for the response, we can return at most 4 MB in a response, but that's 512 pages and likely fine as an upper bound. It would require a bit more memory to first buffer the entire batch and then send it, instead of just streaming them, so we could consider doing in-order streams instead. But maybe it's more efficient to just dump it into a large contiguous array too and just throw it over to Postgres ~directly.\r\n\r\ncc @VladLazar @problame since you probably have opinions here too.",
        "> the pageserver doesn't currently support streaming. The current implementation collects all the deltas and images for all keys in the batch and then does walredo for all keys concurrently. We could do true streaming, but it's not trivial.\r\n\r\nYeah, but Christian wanted to leave the protocol open to send eager out-of-order responses, since it gives us more flexibility in how we optimize reads down the road.\r\n\r\nThis also has implications for how we design the request scheduler and locking in the communicator. If we bake in an assumption that we'll always get complete batches back, it may not be easy to back out of that later if we find that it causes too much contention and tail latency.\r\n\r\nSo I would like us to take a stance now on whether eager partial responses is something we should design for.\r\n\r\n> On how scattered the reads should be: hard to tell. Generally speaking, the more clustered the pages in a request are, the more predictable performance will be\r\n\r\nI think the more important point here is that when we do the batching client-side, we _know_ whether it makes sense to batch or not (i.e. whether to prioritize throughput or latency) -- Postgres will tell us via `smgrreadv`. And if Postgres asks us to batch, it will always batch as contiguous chunks, at the same LSN.\r\n\r\nI think I'm leaning towards changing `GetPageRequest` to take a `block_count` parameter specifying the number of contiguous pages to read, but keep the streaming responses to keep the door open to eager partial responses. But it depends on how the request scheduler design ends up -- if we don't leverage it there, then we may as well just return a full batch.",

It should be possible to use this client both with a stream/connection pool (for the communicator) and without it (for tests and benchmarks). We can either pass in a single connection and stream (tying the client's lifetime to it and preventing concurrent use), or pass in a trait that can be implemented both by the pools and a trivial raw gRPC client. This will have implications for where stream/connection multiplexing should happen. What's your take on this?\r\n\r\n2. The API here should probably be a bidirectional stream that implements the `futures::Stream` trait: return an object that can be used both to send requests and receive responses. This is flexible enough to support both pipelining (i.e. queue depth > 1), multiple responses per request (e.g. eager page emission and informational responses about layer downloads), and out-of-order responses (if we ever want them), while keeping request tracking at a higher level. The `futures::stream` module has helpers that might come in handy for implementing this. We can also keep this `get_page()` as a convenience method that sends a single request without exposing a stream, for non-performance-critical code such as tests.\r\n\r\nIt may be premature to make these decisions before we've prototyped the higher layers (pools and trackers). If we think it is, then we can punt this and implement a Pagebench transport using the raw gRPC client. But if we're reasonably confident about the final shape of this client API then we may as well build and merge it now.",

Just seems to be what Apple's `path_helper` tool outputs with no exceptions. The reason we're using `path_helper` is to support a new feature we added where people can add paths to `$(brew --prefix)/etc/paths`.

to the `function-before` schemas.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR + removing this reference moving coincidentally make it work still.\r\n\r\nHowever, doing so was a dangerous game: on _L793_, `schema` directly comes from another model. The `pop` calls removes the reference to the schema, and mutating schemas from other models has been a known issue. \r\n\r\nYou may be wondering: why this doesn't break things in the example I gave? Surely the `pop` call should have mutated the core schema of `Numeric`. Turns out it doesn't, because `Numeric.__get_pydantic_core_schema__` does not cache the schema, so calling it will generate a new one every time (and this is what happens during the schema gen of `OuterModel`). But on a similar issue, [I mentioned](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/10160#issuecomment-2298257506) that explicitly caching the core schema in the `__get_pydantic_core_schema__` method would resolve the user issue (as the use case was slightly different)! \r\n\r\nSo to conclude, overriding `BaseModel.__get_pydantic_core_schema__` is full of unexpected behaviors, but that's fine as officially supporting them would be a huge pain.\r\n\r\n",
        "iirc (but I'm not sure), I was able to remove it only thanks to the other changes. This won't clutter the git diff though, because it's just a removal. Probably by having a proper commit description when merging, I can add a note about this?",
        "This was present inside `_generate_schema_from_property` before, but actually I think it should come first. Whenever you call `generate_schema`, if we pass in `typing(_extensions).Self`, we need to resolve the type before trying to build the schema.\r\n\r\nI moved it at the top of `GenerateSchema.generate_schema`",
        "Oops, seems like moving it breaks things, it needs to be right after the `__get_pydantic_core_schema__` check, so I'll leave it here"

We currently support a max of 32 keys in a batch (PS side). We could increase it, but I don't think we should go above 512 pages short term. I'd just return all the pages at once.

A brief info section in the docs could help users think about how to deal with this if e.g. they update a setting in a hundred tablets (maybe one crashes or is e.g. replaced by k8s shorter thereafter).\r\n\r\nI would guess that on process normal shutdown all of these pending in-memory changes are flushed? Although I believe we do kill the process in some cases after a period of time and in those cases we can't know for sure.\r\n\r\nThese considerations also make the trade-off with this flag value here more clear.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I don't consider this an issue in any way. I don't think too many people are even aware of `/debug/env`, we don't support a lot of config options there, and this is clearly an improvement. :-) \r\n\r\nAlthough this does make me think... what if you want to play with different settings in a running process w/o affecting the persistent config? Is there a way to do that? I suspect (don't know for sure) there are two primary uses of `/debug/env` today:\r\n1. Change setting in the running process w/o having to restart. You persisted it yourself separately. Clearly this new behavior is an improvement there.\r\n2. Try different settings in the running process to see which one seems to offer better behavior. You may or may not end up persisting a different flag value.\r\n\r\nDo we effectively lose num 2? I guess we could simply document the breaking change in that it's up to the user to reset it back to the default when they're done with their testing (since intermediate temporary test values were likely persisted in the config file). And when choosing to use a config file, you must become aware of this anyway and change your process accordingly. I think that's totally fine and reasonable FWIW. \r\n\r\nPrecedence also comes into play -- we should document that somewhere in the docs (you may already have some place) -- as if they specify the value as a cmd-line flag then that value may override anything that's persisted in the config file anyway (which they may want for a core set of flags).",

        "I would recommend something like this:\r\n```\r\n        // The format specifier is for any optional predicates.\r\n        query := \"SELECT variable_name, variable_value FROM performance_schema.global_status%s\"\r\n        predicates := strings.Builder{} // optional filters\r\n        if len(names) > 0 {\r\n\t\tpredicates.WriteString(\" WHERE variable_name IN (\")\r\n\t        for i, name := range names {\r\n\t\t        if i > 0 {\r\n\t\t\t        predicates.WriteByte(',')\r\n\t        \t}\r\n                        predicates.WriteString(sqltypes.EncodeStringSQL(name))\r\n                }\r\n\t        predicates.WriteByte(')')\r\n        }\r\n        qr, err := mysqld.FetchSuperQuery(ctx, fmt.Sprintf(query, predicates.String())\r\n```\r\n\r\nSelecting the `variable_name` is necessary in order to return a map, which I think we really have to in order for this to be usable with multiple values.\r\n\r\nI also think that the base query should be a const in the package (~ `getGlobalStatusQuery`).\r\n\r\nLastly, I also think that we should build a parsed query here rather than sending the raw unparsed one on. This will add some input validation to protect against intentional or not, unexpected/unwanted behaviors. For example, someone sending in something like `'); drop table mysql.user;` as a var name. For example:\r\n```\r\n\tparsed := sqlparser.BuildParsedQuery(query, predicates.String())\r\n        query, err := parsed.GenerateQuery(nil, nil)\r\n        if err != nil {\r\n             return nil, err\r\n        }\r\n        qr, err := mysqld.FetchSuperQuery(ctx, query)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated to that, we don't have to use Super for this query.",

If so, it would be nice to go ahead and clean up (potentially just in a follow up PR) some of the R2R values; otherwise, I can log a tracking issue for it.\r\n\r\nThe two big things are that we have some unused gaps now that could be filled in and I don't see why we need to use unique IDs across X86 and Arm64 (that is `X86Base` and `ArmBase` can't currently both be R2R ID 1).\r\n\r\nFor the latter point, the general intent of the R2R flags is to track when user code has some `if (Isa.IsSupported) { }` check that isn't taken, because we have to assume it may cause different behavior. However, on x64 some `AdvSimd.IsSupported` check can never be true, so it can't ever cause a difference in behavior and so we shouldn't need to track it at all and so the x64 vs Arm64 R2R IDs should be able to overlap, with them differentiated by a general \"target architecture\" flag instead. \r\n\r\nI believe we should be able to do much like we do in NAOT where we simply track 1 bit per ISA on the relevant architecture. In other words, I expect we could essentially simplify this to almost the same as https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/115983/files#diff-37e89a49ea22a08b2d0502ca3b1716e2dd1bd68cafd3eeb3cd45f5a4406601d3R219, which would also let us avoid needing to track \"specifiable\" or not and needing unique bit entries for cases like `gfni_v512` (which is tracked as `gfni + avx512` for NAOT). We should just need to track the baseline ISA in addition to what NAOT tracks, since that can be disabled for testing user fallbacks.",

If we split it by platform then it's 11 for Arm64 and 23 for x64. Just given the pending work around SVE and AVX, we will likely go over 64-bits in the next release and need to take a break anyways.\r\n\r\nI think the way NAOT has this setup is more flexible and was done because it came online later and was able to handle some of the scenarios that R2R didn't have the foresight to consider.\r\n\r\n> NAOT does not have the versioning problem like R2R.

        "> I do not think we want to have the baseline supported piecemeal (it is unlikely we would be able to it correctly since it is impossible to test). If we want to raise the baseline, we should do it for the whole product. I would not be opposed to raising the product baseline to x86-64-v2.\r\n\r\n👍. I think it would provide a nice simplification in the JIT and libraries for what code paths we need to support. I don't want to raise the bar \"too high\" and negatively impact a significant number of customers, but I do think that `x86-64-v2` and `armv8.1-a` are reasonable baselines at this point.\r\n\r\n> Where is it documented?\r\n\r\nIn https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview, specifically under the Windows 11 document (last updated 2021)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad370ba3-9e00-49fc-8683-43d08338289a)\r\n\r\nWe got the notification that SSE4.2+POPCNT in 24H2+ when we had last reached out about Arm RDM support; although there's also been some news about the boot blocker that exists that went around last year as well.\r\n\r\nAzure, AWS, Google Cloud, and other major cloud providers that specify what hardware they provide are entirely on x86-64-v3 or later. There are also other 3rd party numbers out there, such as the Steam Hardware Survey, which shows 99.78% of reporting users have x86-64-v2 (while 97.31% have AVX and 94.66% have x86-64-v3).\r\n\r\n> When did Intel/Amd stop selling the last processor without x86-64-v2? It is the more interesting date for this discussion.\r\n\r\nFor Intel the last CPUs pre x86-64-v2 were discontinued in 2013, around the time x86-64-v3 was launched. This would have been the Bonnell microarchitecture (part of the Intel Atom lineup for low end machines). The Conroe/Merom and Penryn/Wolfdale chipsets had been discontinued in 2011-2012. AMD discontinued their 10h and Bobcat lineups in 2012-2013 as well.\r\n\r\nSo if we did try to raise the baseline in .NET 11, it should only be for 12-18 year old computers which are no longer supported by the CPU manufacturers, by MacOS, or by current Windows.\r\n"

We can alternatively centralize the unsafe code behind a core helper, for example we have `InvokeSpanIntoSpan` and a pattern that makes use of \"functional interfaces + generics\" to do this for `TensorPrimitives`. This at least reduces risk as the logic that accesses memory can be well tested and not duplicated everywhere. We'll never be able to get rid of *all* unsafe code either, something like `TensorPrimitives` which needs to handle large data needs to be able to pin so it gets access to non-temporal loads/stores, for example.\r\n\r\nI think our goal should therefore really be to move paths like these to use centralized helpers instead of trying to rewrite them to be \"safe\". We know they're important to perf and we know they benefit from unsafe today, so lets pull some of the `InvokeSpanIntoSpan` and `Aggregate` helpers so that cases like this are functionally rewritten to `=> Aggregate<T, IdentityOperator<T>, Crc32Operator<T>>(x)` and all the \"dangerous\" code is centralized. When the JIT finally gets support for eliding bounds checks over `V128.Create(rospan)` that one helper can be rewritten to use the safe pattern and the rest of the BCL implicitly gets it. We can add a number of `Debug.Assert`, memory access checks, and even potentially `opt-in` forced validation path (such as would lightup via a feature switch) to help ensure robustness in the interim.",

However, much more can be set with headers: https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/appendix/configuration/#ProxyAuth.Settings. I could be mistaken, but I thought you could also configure or use custom headers with JupyterLab as well. I will need to look at it further tomorrow morning, however, I'm sure there are other applications for which setting headers to configure them is supported and would be useful. I think with the URI rewriting, the configurable request headers, and allowing to set the application port (not included here but I do have a PR open for this), the notebook controller will be compatible with most web-applications a user could want to deploy. \r\n\r\nHowever, seeing as the issue described here is an issue that is already present, I do not think this is a blocker.

        "This was very briefly discussed on above. However, the RStudio guidelines for using their trademark are very strict (Jupyter is the complete opposite and definitely not a problem, VSCode is still unknown). For RStudio, the only permitted use that could apply is: \"Your project deploys RStudio products in unmodified form supplied by RStudio, PBC **for internal use only**;\". In other words, EKF can probably not use the RStudio logo (you build your own images anyways, but still), and any vendor that offers Kubeflow-as-a-Service (StatCan, though it might pass as internal for now) or provides a distribution. These uses would all need written approval from RStudio to use their logo in the UI. And VSCode is still unknown at this point. \r\nThis is the reason why I would like to have a solution that doesn't require building a new image, but rather just changing a configmap or something similar. This logo issue is something that will also be faced if the Spawner UI becomes more configurable in the future (the admin can create whatever groups of images he wants, and the logos will need to come from somewhere). ",
        "@kimwnasptd I think I just thought of the solution for this. If we use links for the logos that direct to the SVGs hosted in this repository, we can swap the SVGs for something else if using the logos turns out to be a problem. I believe if this would the propagate to all running installations as well (if the cache of the original SVG is cleared). Does this make sense?",
        "Pulling it from the repo wouldn't solve your first point, but it does blur the distribution and way the logo is implemented in the software a bit. It could even directly link to the original source of the RStudio SVG. Indeed, for airgaped environment this might pose a slight problem. However, I think that people in that situation could build their own image (and might already be doing so as they would have a private registry as well). Also, I don't think the functionality of the JWA would actually break, the button would just be empty. \n\nI think the other problem with this is decision is who is responsible for the decision to include the logos or not and who would be responsible if RStudio isn't happy. If I'm the person responsible since it is my PR that adds their logo, I'm fine with that (and would prefer this actually). If I can be the person responsible for this, I'd go for adding the logos and remove them if there is a complaint. I think an argument can be made that the logo is being used according to the guidelines, if internal use is interpreted as \"the kubeflow/wg-notebooks developers deploying unmodified RStudio binaries supplied by RStudio to test their functionality in Kubeflow during development\". ",
        "I only just saw your second comment. Personally, I would then be more in favor of using the button toggle that is there now, but using an SVG with text in it for VSCode and RStudio. This still makes it rather easy for users to customize if they want the actual logos (which they might be allowed to use in their situation). It also allows us to keep using the Jupyter logo (as we can definitely use that one), and works together with https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/5646#pullrequestreview-614539090 as well (assuming I get this implemented quickly).

Users are more likely to describe the pod, but the claim is more accurate.\r\n\r\nTricky. Quite a while ago I asked similar questions and got as answer that users should know that they need to dig down into the dependency chain. The main reason is that they already need to do that for pods: when a Deployment doesn't become ready, there are no events posted for it that explain why pods are not starting. The user has to describe the pods, not the Deployment. That would be an argument in favor of emitting for the claim.\r\n\r\nBut this is coming from the scheduler, which is processing pods. So pod would also make sense and is arguably easier for a user to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Since we effectively ignore the 1st histogram, if there is a counter reset between the 1st and 2nd, we also allow an incompatible bucket layout between the 1st and 2nd histogram.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we cannot just take the 2nd histogram as the 1st and go on.\r\n\r\nWe do have a similar situation with floats, just that we don't have incompatible buckets there (obviously). While we effectively ignore the value of the 1st float (if there is a counter reset between the 1st and 2nd float), we _still_ take the 1st float into account when checking for extrapolation below zero. And that's actually important. A counter reset sets the counter to zero at some point (in this case between the 1st and 2nd float), but this also means that the counter was greater than zero _before_ the reset. We have to limit extrapolation only if the extrapolation would go below zero when extrapolating from the value of the _1st_ sample.\r\n\r\nSo we need to do the same for histograms. However, if the bucket layout is incompatible, we cannot take buckets into account.\r\n\r\n\"Luckily\", I had a lot of thoughts about all of this, inspired by your code in this PR, and by now I believe, we should actually only limit extrapolation based on the count, and not on the buckets, so we don't even have to take buckets into account.",
        "After a lot of thinking about this, I ultimately came to the conclusion that we should not manipulate buckets after all. Sorry for laying this false trail. (Your work was not in vein, because I would not have been able to think about it in this way without it.)\r\n\r\nIn short, we must keep histograms consistent. For one, that means that the sum of all buckets is equal to the count. (Unless there are NaN observations, but that's a story for another day.) If we scale individual buckets, we have to adjust the count accordingly. And that's what you are doing here. However, I think that creates more harm than good. An individual bucket with some weird behavior might throw off the extrapolation for the whole histogram. I also think there is value if the count alone behaves as we are used to with counters.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, this whole heuristics is only a little tweak to avoid overestimating rates and increases. I think using just the count for that is simple, easy to reason with, and probably just right in most cases. In particular, in the new brave world with created-at timestamps, we will have synthetic samples that are zero everywhere (in the count and sum and all buckets), and we'll then stop extrapolation exactly an that sample, which is an exact and perfect result.\r\n\r\nLong story short, I think this code can all go, and we are all good with the simple code above that does the cut-off based on the count.",
        "Thanks for the drawing. I was about to do that myself, but then stopped myself when I thought I had understood the problem sufficiently. Let's see how far this holds.\r\n\r\nI see a problem with your example: You have put the end of the range at the same time as the 2nd (and last) sample in the range. However, that is generally not the case. The range usually goes on a bit after the last sample. If you modify your example accordingly, I'm pretty sure that you won't arrive at a consistent histogram, i.e. where the sum of the buckets is still the same as the count. (This is the problem that @gen1321  fought with in the current state of the code, where he modified the count value to again match the sum of the buckets.)\r\n\r\nWith your lucky coincidence, the outcome of the `increase` operation is essentially the same as the last point in the range, i.e. `count=75 bucket1=15 bucket2=60`. But if you go on a bit to the right with the slopes you have calculated, you'll run into a deviation between the count and the sum of the buckets.\r\n\r\nBut I think you are up to something here. I guess the following could be a working algorithm:\r\n\r\n1. Calculate the zero point solely based on the count, for all the reasons stated, including your very good added point about the optimization for `histogram_count(rate(foo[1m]))`.\r\n2. At that zero point, we virtually add a zero sample, where count and sum and all buckets are zero.\r\n3. Now we effectively redo the whole calculation including the new zero point but extrapolate from the zero point to the previously determined end point (usually the end of the range).\r\n\r\n(This is just the high level description. The detailed flow has to be different for best efficiency.)\r\n\r\nWDYT?",
        "> I wanted to keep the calculation simpler by not taking into account the right hand side.\r\n\r\nYou have to explain to me how to do that if the right boundary of the range does not coincide with a sample.\r\n\r\n> If the duration to zero is outside the duration to start, an individual bucket may still extrapolate to less than zero because it's slope could be steeper and zero point fall inside the duration to start. I assume you wouldn't insert a zero sample in this case. My algorithm I guess could still work by looking at the duration to zero for each bucket.\r\n\r\nIndeed no zero point if count doesn't extrapolate below zero within the relevant range.\r\n\r\nHowever, it will be hard to manipulate individual buckets and still keep the histogram consistent. See what @gen1321 tried in this PR (which attempts to also manipulate count, but that's what we definitely don't want, for all the reasons stated). \r\n\r\n",
        "I fully agree with @krajorama's description of the first two options. I think both are spot on. I will look into @krajorama's POC ASAP (ideally right now, if nothing happens that distracts me or I faint because of the heat :sweat:).\r\n\r\nIdeally, we find an option now that is likely to stay (so we can declare NH stable). (Alternatively, we do something preliminary now and come back to this once it is the last thing that keeps us from declaring stability. Then we can still decide to change our mind or to make an exception from the stability guarantees (\"Will change extrapolation behavior later\"). Needless to say that I would prefer to not make that exception. But I'm getting ahead of ourselves.)",
        "> my only concern is things like custom schemas, resets with different layout, etc. All of those\r\n> make approaches with bucket manipulation really complex.\r\n\r\nI believe that these problems are (with the current state of things) separate from the extrapolation (fortunately). Currently, if there is a mix of buckets with NHCB and standard exponential buckets, we don't return anything (and warn about it). If there are different NHCB bucket boundaries, we don't return anything either. Finally, if we have different standard exponential buckets, we first convert all involved histograms to the lowest-resolution common schema. In other words: Once the rate calculation kicks in, all histograms have the same bucket schema.",
        "About the counter reset between the first two samples: This is actually easy to deal with because we effectively assume a zero sample at the time of the first sample in that case.\r\n(I guess @krajorama note in the POC is only there to let us know that those special cases aren't handled yet, not that these special cases are problematic.)",
        "> About the counter reset between the first two samples: This is actually easy to deal with because we effectively assume a zero sample at the time of the first sample in that case.\r\n\r\nI have to correct myself. This _is_ actually a problem. While it's true that we assume that right after the 1st sample, everything was reset to zero, we will _not_ stop extrapolation there. In the float case, we take the value of the 1st sample and go down from there. We could still stop with extrapolation if we hit zero from that higher starting point, but we generally do not stop extrapolation at the time of the 1st sample.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we want to take into account individual buckets, we either have to stop ignoring the bucket layout for the 1st sample, or we have to treat this specific case (counter reset between 1st and 2nd sample AND 1st and 2nd sample have incompatible buckets) specially by not checking for individual buckets in this case.",
        "Not sure if I fully understand. Could you check the commit I have just pushed to see if it is what you are fishing for?",
        "While looking at this, I had another thought how we might want to encapsulate the param handling a bit better. Instead of this local function and some other bells and whistles, how about having an `fParams` interface like this:\r\n\r\n```Go\r\ntype fParams interface  {\r\n\tNext(ts int64) float64\r\n\tMax() float64\r\n\tMin() float64\r\n\tHasAnyNaN() bool\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere could be one implementation for the variable param series, and one for the constant parameter. The former would pre-populate internal fields to to be used for `Max`, `Min`, `HasAnyNaN`. The latter would store one float value and return it always (or just do `math.IsNaN` for the const value).\r\n\r\nThen you could do many operations in an efficient way without using separate `if` statements everywhere.\r\n\r\n"

        "When I looked at this with you quickly earlier I didn't spot that this is effectively using the `lockResults` channel as a funny sort of concurrency-safe slice, relying on the first loop writing to the channel exactly the same amount of times as the second loop reads the channel because they are both iterating over the same collection.\r\n\r\nThis seems technically correct, but potentially confusing and at risk of being broken under future maintenance. I wonder if we could split the difference and use a wait group for the generation process and but a channel to consume what's being produced so that the consumer loop is directly synchronized with the producer loop.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nlockResults := make(chan lockResult, len(platforms))\r\ngo func() {\r\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\r\n    for _, platform := range platforms {\r\n        wg.Add(1)\r\n        go func(platform getproviders.Platform) {\r\n            // just like before, except now ending with...\r\n            wg.Done()\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n    wg.Wait()\r\n    close(lockResults)\r\n}()\r\n\r\nfor result := range lockResults {\r\n    // Exactly the same as your current \"for range platforms\" loop\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSlightly more machinery, but maybe makes the one-to-one relationship between iterations of these loops a little more explicit, and makes it harder for inconsistencies to creep in under future maintenance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt seems like the function for that outer goroutine could be turned into a generic helper function that we could reuse across many problems like this, though I'd personally wait to see how many more times this comes up before adding it since we don't really have a good place to dump a general-purpose thing like this. :grinning: \r\n\r\n```go\r\n// ConcurrentEach calls f concurrently for all elements of from,\r\n// waits until all calls have returned, and then closes into\r\n// to signal completion before returning.\r\nfunc ConcurrentEach[In, Out any](from []In, into chan<- Out, f func(item In, into chan<- Out)) {\r\n  var wg wg sync.WaitGroup\r\n  for _, item := range from {\r\n    wg.Add(1)\r\n    go func(item In) {\r\n      f(item, into)\r\n      wg.Done()\r\n    }(item)\r\n  }\r\n  wg.Wait()\r\n  close(into)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```go\r\nlockResults := make(chan lockResult, len(platforms))\r\ngo ConcurrentEach(platforms, lockResults, func (platform getproviders.Platform, lockResults chan<- lockResult) {\r\n    // ...\r\n})\r\nfor result := range lockResults {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
        "This seems reasonable for solving exactly the problem as stated, but it seems like if we were to move this down to just before [line 568](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/f653350af64ce92ed5c516690f6ae089e0802492/internal/providercache/installer.go#L568) then we could rely on some of the conditionals we already have in place for the global vs. local situation, and also get locking of the _local_ directory at the same time, which is not quite as popular a request but still something I've seen folks ask about before.\r\n\r\nSpecifically I'm thinking about adding something like the following just before the line I indicated:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nunlockInstallTo, err := installTo.Lock(ctx, provider, version)\r\n// (...error handling...)\r\nvar unlockLinkTo func()\r\nif linkTo != nil {\r\n    unlockLinkTo, err = linkTo.Lock(ctx, provider, version)\r\n    // (...error handling...)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and then unconditionally call `unlockInstallTo` and conditionally call `unlockLinkTo` afterwards.\r\n",
        "I guess what I wrote above means that we'd be doing the `tryInstallPackageFromCacheDir` step without the lock held, which is okay as long as we're only trying to lock the global cache directory -- `tryInstallPackageFromCacheDir` only _reads_ from the global cache directory -- but would not protect the local cache directory. (Not that protecting the local cache directory was a requirement to begin with; just a \"would be nice\".)\r\n\r\nGiven that this locking strategy only applies to _writers_ to the cache directories anyway (concurrent readers can still observe partially-filled package directories), I'm now wondering instead about making `Dir.Lock` be unexported and calling it from the two methods in `dir_modify.go` as an implementation detail, which would help ensure that _all_ cache directory modifications can run concurrently and also address that concern about the various codepaths that neglect to call `unlock`, because `Dir.InstallPackage` can make sure to call `unlock` itself before returning.\r\n",
        "You are right that if we delay acquiring the lock until we get inside `Dir.InstallPackage` then that function would also need to check (immediately after it acquires the lock) whether the desired package had been installed by another process in the meantime.\r\n\r\nFor `InstallPackage` I'm imagining something like this (just a pseudocode-ish sketch, not final code):\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (d *Dir) InstallPackage(ctx context.Context, meta getproviders.PackageMeta, allowedHashes []getproviders.Hash) (*getproviders.PackageAuthenticationResult, error) {\r\n\tif meta.TargetPlatform != d.targetPlatform {\r\n\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"can't install %s package into cache directory expecting %s\", meta.TargetPlatform, d.targetPlatform)\r\n\t}\r\n\tnewPath := getproviders.UnpackedDirectoryPathForPackage(\r\n\t\td.baseDir, meta.Provider, meta.Version, d.targetPlatform,\r\n\t)\r\n\r\n\tunlock, err := d.Lock(ctx, meta.Provider, meta.Version)\r\n\t// (...error handling...)\r\n\tdefer unlock()\r\n\r\n\tif existsAndIsDirOrSymlinkToDir(newPath) {\r\n\t\td.metaCache = nil // another process has modified the cache directory\r\n\t\tif cached, err := d.ProviderVersion(meta.Provider, meta.Version); err != nil && cached != nil {\r\n\t\t\tmatches, err := cached.MatchesAnyHash(allowedHashes)\r\n\t\t\tif err == nil && matches {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn someSuccessfulResult()\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Invalidate our metaCache so that subsequent read calls will re-scan to\r\n\t// incorporate any changes we make here.\r\n\td.metaCache = nil\r\n\r\n\tlog.Printf(\"[TRACE] providercache.Dir.InstallPackage: installing %s v%s from %s\", meta.Provider, meta.Version, meta.Location)\r\n\treturn meta.Location.InstallProviderPackage(ctx, meta, newPath, allowedHashes)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does admittedly have an interesting implication: if we end up at the `return someSuccessfulResult` statement here then _this process_ will not have applied any package authentication rules (from `meta.Authentication`) to the directory, meaning that it's assuming that the other process did that correctly _and_ the \"some successful result\" would not be able to include any verified hashes beyond perhaps the ones that caused `MatchesAnyHash` to return true.\r\n\r\nI think that _does_ technically match the current treatment of cache entries -- `tryInstallPackageFromCacheDir` also only checks that the checksum matches -- but is admittedly quite a different guarantee than this method was previously providing. If that seems acceptable though, I wonder if there's enough overlap between \"is the package in that _other_ cache acceptable to use?\" and \"is the package in _this_ cache acceptable to use?\" that we could factor out the relevant subset of logic from `tryInstallPackageFromCacheDir` and use it from both places.\r\n\r\nOverall here my goal is to limit the time spent holding the lock and to keep the lock handling as an implementation detail of `Dir.InstallPackage`, rather than exposing it as a separate thing that callers need to remember to handle. (and acquire the lock in `Dir.LinkFromOtherCache` too, so that full installation can't race with linking at the same location if someone has a really weirdo configuration.)\r\n",
        "It seems like there are a few places above where we end the iteration of the loop early without calling `unlock`, which I guess is probably not a huge deal since the process will eventually exit and implicitly release the lock, but it we did a little more work down the path I started in https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2166 then we could perhaps factor the body of this loop out into a separate function and use `defer unlock()` to make sure it always gets called on every return path, so that we're not at risk of any quirky behavior in the uncommon cases where we terminate early without unlocking.\r\n\r\n(I don't think we should do that refactoring as part of this PR though, since that sort of thing is better reviewed on its own.)",
        "Oh, I see! I think I misunderstood this when I read it the first time because I didn't consider that (because this is running sequentially) there can only possibly be one outstanding `unlock` at a time, and so it's okay to use only a single `defer` to clean up only that one.\r\n\r\nFair enough!\r\n"

None of the automatic installation, registry protocol, and signature-checking infrastructure that we're accustomed to for provider plugins are available for the legacy provisioner plugins.\r\n\r\nSo I think it's fair to say that _as we currently stand_, \"plugin\" and \"provider\" are _effectively_ synonymous, aside from some little callout boxes in a few spots that acknowledge the legacy provisioner plugin support such as on [Managing Plugins](https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/plugins/).\r\n\r\nThe text below intentionally asks us to reflect on whether we want that to continue to be true.

Make sure to call `t.Helper()` as the first statement in the function so that the test harness knows that it should treat this as a test helper function when it is choosing a source line to report in its generated error message.\r\n\r\n(Similar idea for the `testFile.tempFileWriter` method below too, though of course that one will need to make a separate temp directory for each file since it only works on one file at a time.)",

Therefore this currently works but is at risk of becoming accidentally broken in future if the callers start building these slices in a different way.\r\n\r\nOne way to resolve this while still retaining a similar code style would be to explicitly remove any excess capacity from the source slice before appending to it, and now we've upgraded to Go 1.24 there's [a helper function that's (subjectively) more readable than the three-clause slice syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/slices#Clip):\r\n\r\n```go\r\ncmd = slices.Clip(cmd)\r\nencryptCommand := append(cmd, \"--encrypt\")\r\ndecryptCommand := append(cmd, \"--decrypt\")\r\n```"

I was trying to imply it's added _back_ to `TableBuffer`s `snapshotting_chunks`. \r\n\r\nThe previous operation was \r\n- to remove those keys from the map\r\n- convert them to record batches\r\n- hold it in `snapshotting_chunks`, \r\n- clone it and return the copy back to create persist jobs out of it.\r\n\r\nNow, iterator holds all the keys to remove\r\n- each call to `next()` converts it to record batch and yields it\r\n- this loop creates persist job\r\n- then adds it to `snapshotting_chunks` at the end\r\n\r\nThe main thing is there's a write lock for this operation and hence both these operations should leave `TableBuffer` in same state.",

It's prewarming by replacing unused pages with potentially useful pages, and explicitly not LFC state synchronization.",

Dumping that state is not free, and while it isn't all _that_ expensive it does block all IO operations to the LFC for a short while. Doing the dump regularly will likely cause some (small?) amount of degraded performance.\r\n\r\nIf instead of frequently dumping this state, we should dump the state only when needed (i.e. with pending shutdown or pending restart), so that we'll only degrade performance if and when needed."

The idea is that we can prewarm caches faster when we do it intentionally vs. when user tries to prewarm by just doing their normal workload\r\n\r\nImagine cplane, it eventually accesses all non-deleted projects/endpoint/branches. If we just restart it at Neon, it will take some time to visit all objects.

It's prewarming by replacing unused pages with potentially useful pages, and explicitly not LFC state synchronization.\r\n\r\nRe-reading it after a long time and now it still looks like it should work.

If, after loading page gets modified, then it will be either updated in LFC (in case of primary) or evicted from LFC after receiving the corresponding WAL record (in case of replica). In other words, if pages is not present in the LFC, we will fetch it from the pageserver; if someone (backend, normal client workload) tries to write it concurrently, then the access will be synchronized, and we should still get a freshness guarantee. @knizhnik or @MMeent can correct me, as I'm not fluent in the underlying mechanism, I consider it as given here\r\n\r\nThus, it should be safe to prewarm LFC concurrently with user load. The only problem is performance, I wrote about it in other comments, but anyway. Yes, if it's highly intensive workload, then prewarm can compete for storage resources with user workload, so we can consider auto-prewarm to be user-togglable feature, I wrote about it in the section about auto-prewarm concerns\r\n\r\n@VladLazar @mtyazici let me know if it makes it clearer",

We discarded that because it only helps with keeping a warm replica, and it's not possible to implement autoprewarm with that + it bloats the WAL on safekeepers and eats the network bandwidth. It's not a big problem, as Pageservers should discard such records during ingestion, so it wont bloat the data files, but it's still nice to avoid\r\n\r\n> The idea here is to expose some LFC primitives at the SQL level on the primary.

        "I took a more extensive look at the docs and I propose the following solution:\r\n\r\nThe headers that are used to configure parts of R-Studio are all non-standard headers, starting with `X-*`. Such example headers are\r\n* `X-RStudio-Request`\r\n* `X-RStudio-Root-Path`\r\n* `X-Forwarded-Host`\r\n* `X-Forwarded-Proto`\r\n* `X-Auth-Token`\r\n\r\nSo I propose to go the other way around from blacklisting specific headers. Let's only allow the users to edit/set non-standard headers that start with `X-*`. This way we provide all the necessary configuration for R-Studio and at the same time don't allow the users to edit any header arbitrarily.\r\n\r\nAnd if in the future we find users that need to specifically set well defined headers for a Notebook then we can discuss based on the specific use case on how to proceed and allow users to add more headers.\r\n\r\nThis is the case for the docs I looked up to now\r\nhttps://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/access-and-security.htmlhttps://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/authentication/proxied/\r\nhttps://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/appendix/configuration/#ProxyAuth.Settings\r\n",

But the user could still be able to override this by manually specifying a different value.\r\n\r\nThis way in order for a CR to support RStuido it will only need the `notebooks.kubeflow.org/server-type` annotation, which provides a good default mechanism and extensibility to the users.",
        "> Also, using X-* for headers seems to have been deprecated int 2012: see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648\r\n\r\nThis is a very good argument to make to the folks maintaining the R-Studio code :) \r\n\r\n> However, by backing this into the controller administrators cannot easily customize these values.\r\n\r\nWhat extra headers do you think they would need to set aside, from the `X-*`  headers R-Studio knows/expects?\r\n\r\n> Regarding your last comment, are you suggesting that the current mechanisms added to the controller stay as they are, but the controller itself adds the annotations to the CR when notebooks.kubeflow.org/server-type: rstudio is present?\r\n\r\nNo, the controller will not add any extra annotations if the `server-type` is present. It will only configure the vsvc accordingly.\r\nLet me try to clarify with two examples:\r\n\r\nCR 1:\r\n```yaml\r\nmetadata:\r\n  annotations:\r\n    notebooks.kubeflow.org/server-type: rstudio\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the controller will see that the Notebook is for R-Studio so it will set the `/` url rewrite in the vsvc and also set the `X-RStudio-Root-Path` header in the vsvc for the prefix\r\n\r\nCR 2:\r\n```yaml\r\nmetadata:\r\n  annotations:\r\n    notebooks.kubeflow.org/server-type: rstudio\r\n    notebooks.kubeflow.org/http-rewrite-uri: /some/path\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the controller will first do exactly what it would for CR 1. But then it would also detect the `notebooks.kubeflow.org/http-rewrite-uri` and use this value for the Istio rewrite, instead of the default it previously put. \r\n\r\nAlso the same approach will be used with the `notebooks.kubeflow.org/http-headers-request-set`. If this annotation is present then the controller will use the `X-*` headers mentioned in this annotations instead",
        "> Regarding the server-type thing, we can do that in the future but its not necessary right now.\r\n\r\n@thesuperzapper I can understand your urge to have this effort merged as soon as possible, but this is not a big feature so lets get it right from the beginning and not worry about it in the future. The functionality I described is almost there.\r\n\r\n> Adding a whitelist would only act to reduce the usefulness of this feature for users why might have their own container images.\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate on this? What use cases do you think we limit? With the mention mechanism, of allowing the user to set any `X-*` header they want, we still support all of the configuration options from R-Studio."

Don't use the logos in this PR. We could use the [group options](https://v8.material.angular.io/components/select/overview#creating-groups-of-options) from Angular material, or just use buttons with text [ would prefer the first approach tbh ] to show the images for the different servers\r\n2.

        "For now it's important to follow the existing patterns even if there is some extra code duplication. We can rework the implementation if needed in separate refactor PRs.\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to avoid large duplications is how the `build_attn()` is implemented to use a helper, memory-agnostic method `build_attn_mha()`. This way, the memory-specific logic is implemented in the `build_attn()` overloads and the bulk of the remaining logic is reused by calling `build_attn_mha()`. You can apply this pattern both for `build_rs()` and `build_mambaX_layer()`.",
        "Looking at the `build_mamba_layer()` function, it appears complex, but actually it boils down to something like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbuild_mamba_layer(inp) {\r\n    rec_state = static_cast<...>(mstate);\r\n\r\n    conv = rec_state->update_conv(inp); // analogous to unified get_k() + cpy_k()\r\n    ssm  = rec_state->update_ssm (inp); // analogous to unified get_v() + cpy_v()\r\n\r\n    common = get_common(model);\r\n\r\n    do_something_with_conv(model, common, conv);\r\n    do_something_with_ssm (model, common, ssm);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `get_common(model)` and `do_something_with_...(model, ...)` parts have to be extracted out of this function and remain implemented in `llama-model.cpp` because they use model tensors and do not depend on the memory module. The `update_conv()` and `update_ssm()` function have to be implemented only once in the `class llama_kv_cache_recurrent`. Internally, they can use a helper `build_recurrent_state()` function to deduplicate the code. Note that the hybrid cache will call these methods from the recurrent cache instance and won't have to implement them a second time.\r\n\r\nWhen you decompose the function like this, the implementation becomes much simpler:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbuild_mamba_layer(inp) {\r\n    rec_state = static_cast<...based_on_inp...>(m_state);\r\n\r\n    conv = rec_state->update_conv(inp);\r\n    ssm  = rec_state->update_ssm (inp);\r\n\r\n    return { conv, ssm };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is much easier to overload multiple times for different `inp` types. I would even split it one more time:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// llama-graph:\r\n\r\n// one for recurrent and one for hybrid\r\nbuild_mamba_conv(inp) {\r\n    rec_state = static_cast<...based on inp...>(m_state);\r\n\r\n    conv = rec_state->update_conv(inp->get_s_copy());\r\n    \r\n    return conv;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// one for recurrent and one for hybrid\r\nbuild_mamba_ssm(inp) {\r\n    rec_state = static_cast<...based on inp...>(m_state);\r\n\r\n    ssm = rec_state->update_ssm(inp->get_s_copy());\r\n    \r\n    return ssm;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope I'm not missing something, but I think this should work and should be clean.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can also just bring the PR to a working state any way you think makes sense and then I will try to do a refactoring pass and see how it goes.

So it is very important to me that the data layout is consistent across multiple levels. \r\n\r\nThe correct way to implement the micro-optimization of pre-computing a parameter derived from the human-interpretable parameters is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Pass the human-interpretable parameters to `ggml_opt_step_adamw` / `ggml_opt_step_sdg`.\r\n2. In the CUDA host code, pre-compute some derived parameters from the human-interpretable parameters.\r\n3. Change the CUDA device code to accept the derived parameters instead.\r\n\r\nThe way CUDA works is that the CPU schedules the GPU kernels in a CUDA stream and then waits for said stream to finish all kernels. Scheduling the kernels is of course much faster and it doesn't matter how fast you are as long as you are fast enough to keep the GPU busy. So adding a bit of overhead to the scheduling has essentially no impact on the runtime of a CUDA program even if you do it once per CUDA kernel launch instead of once per epoch.",

        "I'm sympathetic to the literal pattern argument. If we were starting fully from scratch, I think it might make more sense. Specifically, the boolean traps can be a bit confusing. In particular, the fact that you have to set `validate_by_name=True` if `validate_by_alias=False` explicitly is a bit confusing, especially for new users.\r\n\r\nOne thing we could do to mitigate this challenge is automatically set `validate_by_name=True` if a user sets `validate_By_alias=False`.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts re why we should stick with the 2 boolean flags:\r\n\r\n* It represents less change to this setting compared to a switch to literals - there's already a lot of change going on here, and I'm hesitant to introduce a setting `type` change as well.\r\n* 2 boolean flags provide greater configurability for interaction between config and runtime settings, as you can override one behavior and not the other. It's also helpful to have unset markers for each thing. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nM1: validate_by_alias = True, validate_by_name = False\r\nM2: validate_by_alias = False, validate_by_name = True\r\n\r\nruntime setting: by_name = True\r\n\r\n==>\r\n\r\nM1: alias and name validation\r\nM2: name only validation\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can't be achieved with the literal approach. Either you'd use:\r\n* `validate_by='name'`, and M1 would lose alias validation\r\n* `validate_by='name and alias'` and M2 would no longer avoid validating with alias\r\n\r\n* Autocomplete is easier with boolean flags, and the behavior is relatively intuitive\r\n\r\nAliases are one of the most common (if not the most commonly used) field tool, so I do think this decision is quite important.

What I expect to happen here is each unique lambda instantiates a new instance of this template. Since there is a lot of code in this template function, each new lambda given duplicates all this code. That quickly sends the trade-off in the other direction towards `std::function` the moment more than one lambda is passed to this template. Since each lambda is unique and the template approach is an almost certain inline, that prevents the compiler from de-duping the 95+% of the function body that is otherwise identical.",

We probably weren't incurring allocation overhead in any of these changes, but we were paying the indirection cost.\r\n\r\n`std::function`'s type erasure works by using virtual dispatch. The compiler can't inline these virtual function calls as the functions provided could vary and *possibly* carry an allocated closure.",

        "I do not think that pipelining of non-get page requests and get page request is really important. There are only two other frequent requests: exists and nblocks, but both should be eliminated in most cases  by resize cache.\r\n\r\nIs it absolutely necessary to move `consume_prefetch_responses` before sending new non-get page request?\r\nNo, it is not. If we can enforce that in case of error:\r\n1. Connection is dropped\r\n2. Prefetch ring state it reset\r\nthan it is not needed. The original error I have found is that this code calls `page_server->disconnect` which is not resetting prefetch state. My first attempt to fix it was just to add call of `prefetch_on_ps_disconnect()` here.\r\nBut then I thought that it will be safer to consume prefetch responses before sending new request.",

It immediately returns NULL id state is not `PS_Connected`.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have reported is different. Assume that there is some pending interrupt - i.e. statement timeout.\r\nAnd it is invoked from `CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS` places in one of the functions called in TRY block in `page_server_request`. Inn this case CATCH block calls `page_server->disconnect(shard_no);`. But it actually calls `pageserver_disconnect_shard` which drop connection but doesn't reset prefetch state (doesn't call `prefetch_on_ps_disconnect`).\r\n"
